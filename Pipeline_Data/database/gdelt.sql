And now the sea continues to wash them up,\" the center wrote, noting that most of the dead dolphins were from the endangered Azov species.\n\nRussia\'s Emergencies Ministry said Sunday that over 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been removed by officials and volunteers along the shoreline of the Krasnodar region\'s Anapa and Temryuk districts.\n\nRussia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency on Saturday after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula\'s largest city some 250 kilometers (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait.\n\nOn Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an \"ecological disaster.\"\n\nThe Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.\n\nIt has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\'s office, described the oil spill last month as a \"large-scale environmental disaster\" and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.\n\nCopyright 2025 NPR', 'en', NULL, '2025-01-06 00:00:00', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 73.57, 1, 'oil', '2026-01-12 16:37:32', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', '32 dolphins have died since an oil spill near southern Russia, experts say//// https://news.wfsu.org/all-npr-news/2025-01-06/32-dolphins-have-died-since-an-oil-spill-near-southern-russia-experts-say'),

This was expected to pave the way for increased operations on federal property as well as offshore.\n\nHowever, President Biden has thrown a wrench into those plans by signing a “memorandum on the withdrawal of certain areas of the United States outer continental shelf from oil or natural gas leasing.” Citing public stewardship, climate change, and the possible harm to coastal areas and marine life, Biden banned leasing in a number of areas of the outer continental shelf.\n\nThe list is fairly extensive and includes the North Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Straits of Florida in the east as well as the Washington/Oregon, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California sections in the west. The halt also extends to the Eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Northern Bering Sea Climate Resilience Area off Alaska.\n\nMore: President-Elect Trump Set To Allow New And Expanded Drilling For Gas And Oil\n\nThere’s no expiration date, but Biden noted rights under existing leases in the withdrawn areas aren’t affected. However, he said the move “prevents consideration of withdrawn areas for any future oil or natural gas leasing for purposes of exploration, development, or production.”\n\nWhile the memorandum is full of government legalese, the White House released a statement from Biden saying he’s “taking action to protect the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea from oil and natural gas drilling and the harm it can cause.”\n\nHe went on to say “drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs.” The president went on to cite the Deepwater Horizon disaster and say “it is not worth the risks.”\n\nShell\n\nThe Department of the Interior filled in some of the blanks as they noted the memoranda withdraws more than 625 million acres of land. That’s the largest withdrawal in U.S. history, but the department noted oil production on federal lands and waters was at an all-time high last year.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the “Outer Continental Shelf produced approximately 675 million barrels of oil and 796 billion cubic feet of gas, accounting for roughly 14 percent of all oil production and two percent of natural gas production in the United States.” That sounds like a lot, but the government said nearly all production is done in the “Western and Central Gulf of Mexico, where industry has yet to produce on more than 80 percent of the 12 million acres already under lease.”\n\nWhile inauguration day is just two weeks away, CNN noted the executive action is hard to reverse and would need congressional approval. Despite that obstacle, Trump promised to “unban it immediately.”', 'en', 'Michael Gauthier', '2025-01-06 22:30:00', 2, 'The article does not provide a clear prediction of the price of oil based on the given criteria.

The latest to catch our eye? Batana oil, a naturally-occurring ingredient that’s been praised for its potential hair growth benefits.\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nTo get to the bottom of whether this oil can really help strengthen hair and promote growth, we reached out to the experts to find out. Caroline Ruggiero is a Certified Trichologist specializing in treating hair loss and scalp disorders, and the CEO of Truly You Hair & Scalp Clinic in Mississauga, Ont. Read the full interview below.\n\nQ: What is batana oil, and is it safe to use on hair?\n\nA: Batana oil is derived from the nuts of the American palm tree, known scientifically as Elaeis oleifera. It is generally regarded as safe to use on the hair, however ‘natural’ does not always mean safe. Allergies are widespread to varieties of different oils/ nuts etc, and it is best to do a patch test [before use].\n\nQ: What are the potential benefits or side effects of using batana oil?\n\nA: Benefits of batana oil include moisturizing (batana oil is rich in fatty acids and antioxidants), conditioning (it can act as a natural conditioner) — it also has some anti-inflammatory properties that may benefit the scalp by reducing irritation and flakiness.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\nBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.\n\nA welcome email is on its way.

Of course, one should always proceed with caution if they are prone to oily skin/scalp and they are adding oils into an already seborrheic environment. This can create complications in the scalp environment and lead to issues like seborrheic dermatitis.\n\n[Learn more about how to maintain a healthy scalp with dermatologist-approved tips here.]\n\nQ: Who should consider using batana oil?\n\nA: Batana oil can be helpful with dry, brittle, or damaged hair. It can also prove helpful for curly or textured hair types that crave extra moisture and conditioning.\n\nQ: How should you use batana oil (or other oils) in your hair routine?\n\nFor optimal benefits, consider the following ways to incorporate batana oil into your routine:\n\nQ: Are there any other ingredients or products that you recommend to stimulate hair growth?\n\nA: Hair loss is complicated and individual. Its cause is often multifactorial. Scientifically speaking there are first, second and third-line treatments for hair loss disorders.\n\nThe first step is diagnosis. You may suspect a less complicated hair loss issue like Telogen Effluvium (this is a ‘reaction’ hair loss that can occur suddenly as a result of a physiological or psychological shock) but upon trichoscopic analysis, the hair specialist uncovers a more complicated autoimmune scalp or hair disorder. The bottom line is you need to know what kind of hair loss you have and why – then and only then can you determine treatment options.\n\nSome may opt for more ‘natural’ remedies, but you have to know that most of these remedies are third and maybe even fourth-line treatments – this means that no matter what Instagram tells you – the research and evidence for them is just not there.\n\nTopicals like castor oil, rosemary oil, peppermint oil etc. can and do aid in hair loss but they cannot be advertised as proven solutions. Still to this day Minoxidil (the primary ingredient in Rogaine) is a safe, very effective, proven and approved topical treatment specifically for hair loss in both males and females.\n\nSeek professional help and advice first, and then you can explore solutions that work within your budget, ethics and timeline.\n\nOur favourite batana oil products\n\nIf you’re curious about incorporating batana oil into your hair care routine in 2025, here are some products to consider:\n\nShopping Essentials is a category written by research-obsessed shopping experts.

Great Waters Group Chair Jenny Abel presented the award at the holiday party in December.\n\nIn that role and even before she worked for Citizen Action, Guiden has been an active member of our coalition that is addressing the issue of energy burden in Milwaukee. She has been a leader in this movement to try to hold We Energies accountable for the disproportionately high percentage of income that majority Black and Latine neighborhoods have to devote to energy bills. She has organized teach-ins, protests in front of We Energies’ offices, a speak-out and speak-up event on Sherman and Burleigh, knocked on doors in northside neighborhoods to collect energy burden stories from residents, and provided neighbors with bus passes so they could travel to public hearings to testify about their experiences with high electricity and gas bills.\n\nGuidenlead]also conducts audit walks. Recognizing that climate change is causing more frequent and more severe storms and that in neighborhoods lacking a lot of green space there can be a lot of standing water after big storms, Guiden’s audit walks involve looking for downed power lines and trees. She takes pictures of what she finds and sends them to the city and county offices that can remove them. In addition to doing these walks around Milwaukee city neighborhoods, Guiden has also done audit walks in Franklin and Oak Creek.\n\nGuiden also works with Wisconsin Climate Table, where she helps to collect stories from those most affected by the current climate emergency. She volunteers with 1000 Friends and advocates for safe streets for pedestrians and bike riders. She pushes for the development of green spaces and tree canopies, and the removal of impervious surfaces.\n\nGuiden is also volunteering with the Sierra Club in its fight to stop the construction of new fossil gas plants. In the past year she distributed 3,000 weatherization kits to her neighbors. She has organized a wellness fair, is a Climate Action Navigator with the state Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy; serves on the state climate justice committee of the NAACP; and volunteers with Forward Wisconsin, Clean Economy Coalition of Wisconsin and the Coalition on the Lead Emergency.\n\nMeanwhile, Guiden finds time to be a proud mother, grandmother and friend to the many community members whose lives she has touched. The Great Waters Group is grateful to benefit from Guiden’s energy, passion and dedication in the local Sierra Club work.\n\nThe Great Waters Group is the local, four-county affiliate (Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties) of the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club is America’s largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with more than 3.5 million members and supporters. In addition to protecting every person’s right to get outdoors and access the healing power of nature, the Sierra Club works to promote clean energy, safeguard the health of our communities, protect wildlife, and preserve our remaining wild places through grassroots activism, public education, lobbying and legal action.\n\nNOTE: This press release was submitted to Urban Milwaukee and was not written by an Urban Milwaukee writer.

sector', 'Photo/NYT News Service\n\n\n\n\n\nWAHINGTON: The United States and Britain on Friday announced sanctions against Russia\'s energy sector, including oil giant Gazprom Neft , just days before outgoing President Joe Biden leaves office.The US Treasury Department said it was designating more than 180 ships as well as Russian oil majors Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, fulfilling \"the G7 commitment to reduce Russian revenues from energy.\"At the same time, the UK government announced sanctions against the two companies, saying their profits were \"lining (Russian President Vladimir) Putin\'s war chest and facilitating the war\" in Ukraine.\"Taking on Russian oil companies will drain Russia\'s war chest -- and every ruble we take from Putin\'s hands helps save Ukrainian lives,\" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said in a statement.\"Putin is in tough shape right now, and I think it\'s really important that he not have any breathing room to continue to do the god-awful things he continues to do,\" Biden told reporters Friday at the White House.Gazprom Neft slammed the sanctions as \"baseless\" and \"illegitimate,\" Russian state news agencies reported.\"Gazprom Neft considers the decision to include its assets on the sanctions list as baseless, illegitimate and contrary to the principles of free competition,\" Russian state news agencies quoted a company representative as saying.Oil prices rose on the news, with a barrel of Brent North Sea crude oil for delivery in March up 3.6 percent at $79.68 at around 4:45 pm in Washington (2145 GMT).Asked about gasoline prices, Biden conceded costs could rise \"as much as three, four cents a gallon,\" but stressed that sanctions would have a \"more profound impact\" on Russia.- \'Sweeping action\' -Even before the sanctions were officially announced, rumors of fresh designations sparked condemnation from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who told reporters that the Biden administration was trying to leave incoming US President Donald Trump \"as heavy a legacy as possible.\"In total, the United States announced sanctions against almost 400 people and entities.These include 183 oil-carrying vessels, along with Russian oil traders and oilfield providers, the two Russian oil majors, and more than two dozen of their subsidiaries, according to the Treasury Department.Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced plans to speak with Putin about the sanctions, which also affect Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), majority-owned by Russia\'s Gazprom Neft and its parent company, Gazprom.NIS is the only supplier of gas to Serbia and the majority owner of both gas pipelines that transport gas from Russia to households and industries in the country.\"Today, the United States imposed the most significant sanctions yet on Russia\'s energy sector, by far the largest source of revenue for Putin\'s war,\" Daleep Singh, the Biden administration\'s deputy national security advisor for international economics, said in a statement.Senior administration officials told reporters the measures were designed to give the United States additional leverage to help broker a \"just peace\" between Ukraine and Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the United States for introducing the sanctions.\"These measures deliver a significant blow to the financial foundation of Russia\'s war machine by disrupting its entire supply chain,\" he wrote in a post on the social media platform X.- Strong economy influenced timing -Friday\'s announcement comes just 10 days before Biden is due to step down, and puts President-elect Trump in something of an awkward position given his stated desire to end the Ukraine war on day one of his presidency.Asked about the timing, National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that oil markets were now in a \"fundamentally\" better place than they had been in the aftermath of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and that the US economy was also faring better.\"We believe the moment was ripe right now to adjust our strategy,\" he said.The US State Department announced it was also taking action against Russia\'s energy sector, \"sanctioning nearly 80 entities and individuals, including those engaged in the active production and export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia.\"Among those it designated were people involved in Russia\'s metals and mining sector, \"and senior officials of State Atomic Energy Corporation Rosatom.\"The move sparked condemnation from Rosatom, which called it \"unreasonable and unlawful\" in nature.\"The sanctions are perceived as an element of unfair competition on the part of unfriendly states,\" Rosatom said in a statement published by several

Maduro could stay power, crush any uprising, and prevent González from entering the country from exile. At the other end of the spectrum, there is also a small chance the military could hand over power to González, or Machado could inspire mass protests to overthrow the government.\n\nBut the most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Maduro will cling to power and the US will prioritize other international issues as US President Joe Biden hands over power to US President-elect Donald Trump Jan. 20.\n\n“The odds of Maduro stepping down are definitely not zero. But it would take a concerted effort from the US to achieve that,” Fernando Ferreira, director of geopolitical risk service at Rapidan Energy Group, said. “It’s not something Biden can do on the way out, and it probably won’t be a priority for Trump,” he said.\n\nStill, the inauguration could provide a turning point for the US to change its oil sanctions policy and scale back some or all of the licenses it has issued for companies to operation in Venezuela.\n\nS&P Global Commodity Insights analysts expect Trump to cancel all licenses except for the Chevron license. “We have 2024 production averaging 806,000 b/d, staying flat at 806,000 b/d in 2025, and declining to 784,000 b/d in 2026,” under this scenario, said Nick Blanco, a senior research analyst at Commodity Insights.\n\nIf Maduro is sworn in again on Jan. 10, there may be a desire to punish Maduro, Ferreira said. “We will see how that affects the Chevron license, whether there will be new restrictions around that,” he said.\n\nAny change to the Chevron license could alter the investment appetite in Venezuela, Ferreira said. Companies with operations on the ground are taking a wait-and-see approach to see what happens around January 10 or what happens when Trump comes in, he said.\n\n“A lot of companies are taking a more cautious approach there,” Ferreira said.\n\nOptions to pressure Maduro\n\nIf the Trump team is serious about democratizing Venezuela, sanctions alone are not going to do it, Ferreira said. The US would need a whole of government approach, which may include offering very large rewards for the capture and arrest of Venezuelan officials, he said.\n\nIt would help if the US revoked the oil licenses, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “You’ve got to at least try to provide some additional pressure to try to get people on the inside thinking about whether they will exit in a certain way,” he said.\n\nBut Berg also said oil sanctions would not be enough to push Maduro out. An effective strategy also should go after illegal gold mining and illegal drug trafficking because they provide so much revenue to the regime, Berg said.\n\nThese are international networks and there is no transparency into how much money Maduro is making from them, Berg said.\n\n“In my opinion, if you don’t deny the regime the ability to expand those networks and build a truly global criminal network that brings them a lot of money, you can’t get after this problem of regime survival,” Berg said.\n\nBut investigating a global criminal network with state support takes a lot of time and resources, and it is unclear whether any administration is going to put that level of resources into Venezuela policy, Berg said.\n\nOpposition pins hopes on González\n\nGonzález is planning to return to Venezuela to be sworn in Jan. 10 and is now trekking the globe to garner support for that goal.\n\nAfter meeting with González Jan. 6, Biden said he would be following the planned Jan. 9 protests in Venezuela and he underscored the US commitment to continue to hold Maduro and his representatives responsible for their anti-democratic actions, according to a White House statement.\n\nGonzález also met with US lawmakers Jan. 6, including Representative Mike Waltz, Republican-Florida, the incoming White House National Security Advisor for the Trump administration.\n\nDespite meeting with González, Biden so far has failed to signal any policy shifts, said Rachel Ziemba, a senior advisor for consultancy Horizon Engage.\n\n“This means that the status quo will continue, and decisions left to the future,” she said. Republicans in Congress have also made strong statements in support of González but have said little about how the US should make sure he is president, she said.\n\nIf González does take power in a way deemed legitimate by the US, relations between Washington and Caracas are expected to normalize, which would lead to an end of sanctions, Blanco said.\n\nThis would clear the way for international investment, but a real production resurgence would take some time to gain momentum, as power, oil and shipping infrastructure is repaired, Blanco said.\n\nIf González takes power on Jan. 10, there would only be minor improvements to supply in the short-term, Blanco said.\n\n“The real impact would come in the medium term as infrastructure repairs and upstream investment bear fruit,” he said.\n\nThe only way to reconstruct the Venezuelan economy, infrastructure and services of the country is through an investment of more than $50 billion, coming from private capital, said Jesús Seguías, president of polling firm Datincorp.\n\n“And no businessman, either Venezuelan or foreign, is going to invest significantly in a country that is on fire on all four sides,” Seguías said. “Therefore, the solution to the crisis must necessarily be peaceful, orderly and effective, that is, through agreements between the government and the opposition,” he said.\n\nSource: Platts', 'en', NULL, NULL, 3, 'Forte pertinence (choc majeur ou immédiat sur les prix) et évaluation de l\'impact direct ou indirect sur l\'offre ou la demande mondiale de pétrole.', 63.73, 1, 'oil', '2026-01-13 18:37:15', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Venezuelan inauguration seen as possible turning point for US oil sanctions policy//// https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/venezuelan-inauguration-seen-as-possible-turning-point-for-us-oil-sanctions-policy/'),

Here’s what to know', 'By Christian Edwards and Anna Chernova, CNN\n\n(CNN) — In the capital of Transnistria, a self-declared microstate sandwiched between Moldova and Ukraine, the festive New Year’s lights have gone dark ahead of schedule. This separatist sliver of Moldova will run out of energy in three weeks, the head of its Russia-backed government has said.\n\nOnce proud, go-it-alone and richer than their neighbors in Moldova proper, Transnistrians are now burning wood to keep warm through hours-long blackouts as winter bites.\n\nThe crunch began when Moscow stopped pumping natural gas through pipelines in Ukraine to Europe. Transnistrian officials have declared a state of emergency. They say their region is facing “not only an energy crisis, but a humanitarian one.” Analysts say this understates the problem, which has raised questions about the future of the de facto state.\n\n“This is an existential question (for Transnistria),” Vadim Pistrinciuc, director of the Institute for Strategic Initiatives (ISI), a think tank in Moldova, told CNN.\n\nHere’s what you need to know.\n\nHow did the crisis start?\n\nFor years, Russian gas flowed through Ukraine to Moldova and elsewhere in Europe. The last transit agreement with Kyiv, signed before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, was due to expire on January 1. Ukraine said for months it would not renew the agreement – and made good on its promise.\n\nSome countries prepared for this. Austria said it did its “homework” and now sources gas elsewhere. Hungary and Slovakia have also found alternative, much costlier, supplies.\n\nTransnistria did not. After splitting from Moldova in 1990 as the Soviet Union crumbled, Transnistria has relied entirely on Russian gas – delivered through Ukraine’s pipelines, mostly free of charge – to keep the lights on.\n\nThat’s over. With Russia unwilling to send gas via other routes, Transnistria is going dark.\n\nHow has Transnistria been affected?\n\nHome to more than 300,000 people – mostly Russian speakers – Transnistria celebrated Orthodox Christmas on Tuesday. The usually festive occasion was interrupted by the region’s self-proclaimed government announcing daily eight-hour power outages.\n\nThe government said it took the decision after electricity consumption had jumped fourfold in recent days. With no gas to keep homes warm, residents had turned to electric heaters – putting huge strain on the region’s creaking power grid.\n\n“The system created during the Soviet period… is not coping,” President Vadim Krasnoselsky said at a meeting of the region’s energy council on Monday. He urged residents to use electric heating “selectively.”\n\nVideos posted online show a glimpse of how residents are coping. Transnistrians are cooking meals on electric mini-stoves and burning firewood and coal to heat their homes. Hot water is now supplied on a strict schedule, causing some to boil water in kettles and take showers using buckets.\n\nSome alternative heating methods have proved hazardous. Orthodox Christmas was marked by two cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, one of them fatal.\n\nOn Tuesday, a family of four in the city of Bendery, including a 7-year-old child, fell ill due to fumes from a gas water heater. They were treated and released in a stable condition. The following night in the capital, Tiraspol, a woman died while showering in a poorly-ventilated apartment where a chimneyless gas water heater was in use, according to the region’s Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nUnable to keep classrooms warm, schools and colleges have extended the winter vacation until January 20, far later than scheduled. Many kindergartens have not reopened after the holidays. The ones that have are burning firewood for heating.\n\nSergey Obolonik, minister for economic development, said Wednesday that the region’s gas reserves will last for another 24 days.\n\nHas Moldova also been hit?\n\nYes, but not as badly. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Moldova was almost entirely reliant on Russian gas. But a few months into the war, Russia’s energy giant Gazprom sharply cut gas supplies to the country and hiked its prices, citing unpaid debts.\n\nMoldovan officials were perplexed – and some cried foul, describing the move as an attempt to “blackmail” the country for a pivot towards the West. With winter approaching, Moldova swiftly arranged energy supplies from Europe.\n\nDespite ending gas purchases from Russia, it still bought large amounts of its energy from Transnistria, which uses Russian gas to generate electricity at the Cuciurgan power plant.\n\nNow Russian gas supplies have been cut off, that plant is producing vastly less energy. Moldova has had to buy from emergency European markets – mostly via Romania – at nearly twice the price.\n\nFurther costs are on the horizon, too. Moldova’s government in Chisinau, led by the recently re-elected pro-Western President Maia Sandu, has said it will provide support to residents fleeing from the freezing temperatures and energy shortages in Transnistria.\n\nWill Transnistria accept help from Chisinau?\n\nChisinau has offered to sell gas and energy to Transnistria, although officials in Tiraspol show little sign of accepting the offer.\n\nThe main reason is economic. Unlike Moscow, Chisinau is not proposing to send gas for free. After 30 years of abundant, low-cost energy, Transnistrians would now have to pay the same rate as those in Moldova proper.\n\n“It’s a problem of costs for the residents of Transnistria,” Nicu Popescu, Moldova’s former foreign minister, told CNN. “Moldova has been much more prepared for such a situation. Transnistria has not done anything in 30 years to be prepared.”\n\nAnother reason is political. After decades of proclaiming its independence from Moldova, to be seen accepting “help” from it would be akin to admitting failure.\n\nInstead, Tiraspol is attempting to pin the crisis on Chisinau. Krasnoselsky has accused Moldova of trying to “strangle” the region and force it to renounce its claims to statehood.\n\nWhat’s Russia’s role?\n\nRussia could provide gas to Transnistria but is choosing not to. Although it can no longer transit gas through Ukraine, other pipelines are available under the Black Sea via Turkey, albeit at a higher cost than before.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the situation is “critical,” but added that “the decisions of Ukraine and the Moldovan authorities” had “deprived” Transnistria of natural gas.\n\nPeskov said some European countries, including Slovakia, still wanted Russia’s “more competitive” supplies. He also criticized the United States for profiting from the crisis, saying it had boosted its costlier gas exports to Europe.\n\nRussia may also stand to gain from declining to end the energy crisis in Transnistria – whose people it claims to support.\n\nRussia has long worked to destabilize Moldova, most recently in its presidential election in October, which was framed as a choice between Moscow and the West.\n\nAlthough polls had predicted a comfortable victory for Sandu, she ultimately won re-election by the thinnest of margins. She later said the vote had been marred by an “unprecedented assault” by foreign actors. CNN has previously reported on Russia-backed efforts to sway the result through a vast vote-buying campaign, accusations the Kremlin consistently denied.\n\nAlthough Sandu clung on in October, Moldova has parliamentary elections later this year. The crisis in Transnistria – which could prompt thousands of residents to flee across the border – provides Russia with an opportunity to sow more chaos in Moldova, Popescu warned.\n\n“Russia doesn’t care much about residents in Transnistria. It has the goal of destabilizing the Moldovan economy, political system and social fabric. It doesn’t care about Transnistrians freezing in winter,” he said.\n\nWhy did Ukraine not renew the gas transit agreement?\n\nUkraine was widely expected to let the agreement lapse, sensing an opportunity to inflict costs on Russia and its allies.\n\nAfter Russian gas stopped flowing through Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky called the move “one of Moscow’s greatest defeats.” He accused the Kremlin of using energy as a “weapon” with which to blackmail its partners.\n\nAlthough Ukraine now faces a loss of some $800 million a year in transit fees from Russia, Gazprom stands to lose far more, at up to $5 billion a year in sales, according to Reuters.\n\nRussian officials have responded furiously to the move. Russia’s Embassy in Moldova said Kyiv had “cynically” stopped the flow of gas to “condemn the population of Transnistria to suffering.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called the decision “bullying and neo-Nazism.”\n\nPistrinciuc, director of the ISI think tank, said he hoped these narratives did not take hold among Transnistrians. He said the crisis might make some confront what he described as the reality of their situation: “It’s a very isolated region… We hope that they see the impotence of this type of unrecognized state.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Indian Oil Corp. also snapped up two million barrels of WTI Midland via a tender, according to traders with knowledge of the matter.Meanwhile, Chinese buyers, including state-owned Unipec, as well as private refiners in Shandong, lifted imports of Angolan. Traders also said a local processor picked up prompt supplies of Abu Dhabi oil.The surge in buying interest from Indian and Chinese buyers has stemmed not only from fewer and pricier offers of Urals, ESPO and Iranian Light crude, but also from fears of more sanctions on tankers used to transport these cargoes and the implications on refiners and others in the supply chain, traders said.The apparent shift in purchasing patterns comes at a time when global crude futures have been advancing as Washington continues to tighten curbs on Tehran and Moscow, as well as companies offering logistical and financial assistance to the nations. The Trump administration has threatened to further tighten curbs on Iranian flows, before the US government changeover happens, while outgoing Biden officials have added to restrictions on tankers and pledged to take a tougher stance on Russia.In China, ports in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong, home to the world’s biggest buyers of Iranian crude, have been urged by their parent company to forbid sanctioned oil tankers from docking or offloading at their terminals, according to people with the knowledge of the directive.Amid the shifts, Middle Eastern grades have been a key beneficiary due to their medium-sour quality, geographical proximity and readily-available cargoes.

However, a spokesman for the command later told DPA that the tanker would not be moved for the time being.\n\nThe spokesperson noted that further steps are being discussed with the authorities and shipping company to deal with the situation.

The funding comes from the 2021 Infrastucture Investment and Jobs Act, along with state match funding. He says AEA awarded the first grant to Golden Valley, because the projects outlined in its applications were important and shovel-ready.\n\n“They were quality applications and definitely there was a need, and the funding matched the need,” he added.\n\nIntertie maintenance, upgrades\n\nThe $20.9 million grant package will pay for three projects, the largest is a $10.3 million upgrade on a stretch of the Alaska Intertie. That’s one of two high-voltage transmission lines that connects Golden Valley to Palmer-based Matanuska Electric Association, Anchorage-based Chugach Electric and Homer Electric, on the Kenai Peninsula.\n\nBradish says the project will reduce outages and transmission-line damage caused by heavy snow.\n\n“It\'s important to keep those things in mind, especially when we\'re talking about extreme weather events, like the storm that we experienced in October that cost our members over $8 million, she said.”\n\nGVEA One of the projects includes relocating transmission-line poles that run through permafrost-ridden areas, to keep them poles from sinking.\n\nGolden Valley will do some similar upgrades on transmission lines in its service area that run from Fairbanks to Fox and Ester and between Fort Wainwright and Salcha. That’s part of a nearly $9 million project that’ll also include relocating transmission-line poles that run through permafrost-ridden areas, to keep them poles from sinking.\n\n“It was constructed in the ’60s and ’70s,” she said, “so this is a really good example of work that would just need to be done, regardless.”\n\nThe third project is the $1.7 million Alaska Railbelt Synchrophasor and Disturbance Reporting System.\n\n“It will provide the rail belt transmission operators with high-speed automated analysis of data,” she said, “from the tip of the Kenai Peninsula all the way up into GVEA’s service territory.”\n\nBradish says the system will provide real-time critical data on electrical currents and voltages for the utilities. That’ll help keep power flowing smoothly and reduce damage to the grid.\n\n“It really is aiming to reduce systemwide disturbances based on being able to look at that data more quickly, she added.”\n\nThayer, with the Alaska Energy Authority, says the agency will award a second round of grants to Alaska utilities later this year.', 'en', 'Kuac', '2025-01-10 00:00:00', 3, 'Forte pertinence (choc majeur ou immédiat sur les prix)', 73.83, 1, 'energy', '2026-01-13 18:37:15', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Alaska Energy Authority awards grants for GVEA local, grid work//// https://fm.kuac.org/energy-and-the-environment/2025-01-10/alaska-energy-authority-awards-grants-for-gvea-local-grid-work'),

The latest concerns the state’s third largest hydro project that has become a Trojan Horse for Green New Deal programs. “Cronyism, abuse and manipulation of our critical energy infrastructure is the result of ‘stakeholder inclusion’,” as energy expert Kassie Andrews writes in this two-part post.\n\nAt 40 MW capacity, the Eklutna Hydro Dam Project generates 5–6 percent of the total electricity for the Railbelt. Eklutna provides the most significant share of renewable energy, 44 percent of Matanuska Electric Association (MEA)’s renewable portfolio and 25 percent of Anchorage area-service-provider Chugach’s renewable portfolio.\n\nWith capital depreciation and small operating costs, Eklutna is the lowest-cost electricity source for Southcentral Alaska. Assuming carbon dioxide is of concern, this project offsets approximately 72,500 metric tons of CO2 annually, equivalent to 16,911 gasoline powered passenger vehicles driven for one year, equating to roughly half of daily commuters on the Glenn Highway.\n\nChugach’s effective share of Eklutna is 64.3 percent, up to 25.7 megawatts. Allowing for storage of spring and summer runoff, Eklutna Hydro acts as a pseudo storage battery for power generation and provides on demand firm spinning reserve capacity. Natural economics, no special government subsidy required.\n\nThis was demonstrated in the early 2024 cold snap. During the seven-day coldest duration (January 28–February 3, Anchorage Airport reading), the average capacity factor of Eklutna was 77 percent. Compare this to 17.6 MW Fire Island Wind at an average capacity factor of 20 percent, with 0% on February 1, 2024. For Alaskans, wind and solar is 100% unreliable, when we need it most.\n\nNew Hydro Politics\n\nThe Upper Eklutna Dam was a Federal Bureau of Reclamation Project, constructed in the 1950s. While the transfer of ownership in Eklutna Hydro to the parties of today became official in 1997, a stipulation of the sale was a congressionally approved Fish and Wildlife Agreement. Think politics, and of the worst kind.\n\nThe 1991 Fish and Wildlife Agreement acknowledged that hydroelectric developments may have resulted in a “yet to be quantified impact to fish and wildlife resources.” Since the project was not subject to FERC licensing, there “is no opportunity to determine the extent of that fish and wildlife impact.”\n\nThe Project Owners, the Municipality of Anchorage, Chugach Electric Association, and Matanuska Electric Association were required to examine and quantify “if possible” the impacts to fish and wildlife from the Eklutna Project. They were to develop proposals for the protection, mitigation and enhancement of fish and wildlife affected by hydroelectric development.\n\nThe Municipality of Anchorage lost voting rights on the Eklutna Hydro Electric Project and, subsequently, the 1991 Fish and Wildlife Agreement, when Chugach acquired Municipal Light & Power in 2020.\n\nThe timeline set forth in the agreement required the owners to initiate the study process “no later than 25 years after the transaction date,” this process began in 2019, three years early. A final fish and wildlife plan was due to the Governor at least three years prior to implementation in 2027. The final proposed plan was submitted in April of 2024.\n\nNew Proposed Agreement\n\nThe agreement gave the power to the Governor to issue the final program and remediation plan. The agreement stipulates that the Governor must give equal consideration to the following:\n\nthe purposes of efficient and economical power production\n\nenergy conservation\n\nthe protection, mitigation of damage to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife\n\nthe protection of recreation opportunities,\n\nmunicipal water supplies\n\nthe preservation of other aspects of environmental quality\n\nother beneficial public uses\n\nrequirements of State law\n\nA critical aspect to major projects is stakeholder engagement. Deciding who becomes part of your project, or in this case who should not be involved can make or break the budget, schedule and can negatively affect the outcomes of the project. A grand misstep in the process was the expansion of the consultation process to include “not only the parties to the 1991 Agreement, but also the Native Village of Eklutna (NVE), Eklutna, Inc., The Conservation Fund, Trout Unlimited, Alaska Pacific University, and several other stakeholders interested in the project.”\n\nA New Narrative\n\nEven before the study process began, a narrative was built around the idea that damages to be mitigated included bringing back a sockeye salmon run that existed prior to the placement of the original dam that was constructed in 1929. That dam, the Lower Eklutna River Dam, was removed in 2018 with primary support and funding of the “stakeholder” Conservation Fund, headed by Brad Meiklejohn, who has written extensively in support of degrowth and overpopulation, shamelessly admitting he is in favor of “rapidly downsizing” the United States population to “one hundred million Americans.” And in a statement that should disqualify citizenship, “The last thing the world needs is more Americans, but the second to last thing the world needs is more people.”\n\nWhile the removal of the Lower Eklutna River Dam helped to solidify the standing of The Conservation Fund as a stakeholder to the future of Eklutna, it did not restore the water to the full length of the river.\n\nThe Native Village of Eklutna (NVE) on the remaining Upper Eklutna Dam states\n\nno water spills over the Eklutna Lake Dam down the river except during floods. A 4.5-mile bypass tunnel diverts water from the lake to the power plant. Of the water diverted, 90 percent is diverted to the Knik River for hydropower, while 10 percent is diverted for Anchorage drinking and wastewater, effectively blocking the remaining 14 miles of Eklutna River from its water source.\n\nA portion of the Eklutna River has been left dry, therefore affecting fish runs.\n\nGetting Fishy\n\nIn the Supporting Information Document of the Proposed Final Plan, the Project Owners highlight statements regarding fish made by NVE through Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The document states: “The Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) from NVE indicates that there was a sockeye salmon run in Eklutna Lake before the lower dam was constructed in 1929.”\n\nHowever, in a 2011 report, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) stated\n\nIt is doubtful that significant numbers of sockeye salmon ever spawned in the Eklutna River drainage because suitable spawning area upstream of the lake is limited and water quality in the lake would likely have limited opportunities for spawning in the littoral zone of the lake. Fully 80 percent of the water entering Eklutna Lake comes from two glacial streams that would not be conducive to the consistent survival of sockeye salmon from egg to fry, and the remaining spawning area would not be sufficient to support large numbers of spawning anadromous salmon. In addition, the physical limnology studies of Eklutna Lake suggest that the turbidity in Eklutna Lake during much of the year is not conducive to significant primary production.\n\nAnd\n\nA separate study was conducted by Loso et al. to try to determine “whether there was an anadromous salmon run into Eklutna Lake prior to 1929” by using marine derived nutrients (MDN) as a biochemical marker in lake sediment. The study found that there was no significant difference in the composition of sediment layers from before and after 1929. However, a sensitivity test was conducted to assess the possibility that a small salmon run may have gone undetected by the isotopic analysis. It was determined that “a salmon run of up to 1,000 per year, and potentially as many as 15,000 per year, would be possible without noticeably altering the measured isotopic composition of the sediments in Eklutna Lake.” Therefore, the results “provide no evidence that such runs occurred, but do not preclude the possible existence of a relatively small sockeye fishery in Eklutna Lake before 1929.\n\nExperts are telling us the lake doesn’t support fish because it doesn’t generate food. There is, however, an abundant, albeit stocked, source of fish at Eklutna Trailrace exists for all Alaskans, with a 2019 stocking plan stating objectives of an 7,500 return of coho and 4,000 return of chinook salmon.\n\nThe draft plan, published in October of 2023, outlined the preferred option being to return water flow to 11 of 12 miles of the Eklutna River. This came with a price tag of $57M, with the study alone costing the project owners $8M through November 2023.\n\nEvolution of Plan\n\nAfter the draft plan was published in October of 2023, the screams by environmental activist stakeholders and the Native Village of Eklutna became louder. In response to the plan, NVE wrote a letter to the Anchorage Assembly on November 10, 2023. This letter highlighted NVE’s disapproval with the draft plan where they unveiled their wishes for the fate of the dam – “We propose simply removing the Eklutna Lake dam within the next decade when sufficient renewable generation capacity exists to replace any power production capacity lost at Eklutna.”\n\nAccording to NVE, the only viable solution was to remove the Eklutna Dam, along with the clean, reliable and affordable power and water to 90 percent of Anchorage residents it provides only to be replaced with other nonexistent sources – most likely not inexpensive, firm and reliable. In closing, NVE stated:\n\nWe are committed to the expansion of renewable energy in Southcentral Alaska, and we are eager to work with all parties towards that goal. Recent projections are that Alaska will easily meet the 80% renewable portfolio standard by 2040 given the known opportunities that include a major expansion of the Bradley Lake hydro that will generate more power than the Eklutna project, and an estimated 200 MW of new wind and solar projects under consideration across the Railbelt.\n\nIn a December 4, 2023, letter to the consultant overseeing the draft fish and wildlife plan, NVE slammed the Project Owners for excluding dam removal as an alternative, calling it an “egregious error” in the environmental analysis. According to NVE, “Dam removal is a reasonable alternative because it would provide the most protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and wildlife at a cost far lower than the alternatives considered.”\n\nIn an attempt to validate the idea of removing the dam, NVE cited a technical report done in 2011 by the US Army Corps of Engineers –\n\nIn 2011, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”) proclaimed that “[t]rue restoration of the Eklutna River ecosystem would require removal of both dams […].”\n\nHowever, NVE failed to include the rest of the sentence in the report –\n\nat a cost estimated to be well beyond the funding limits on the 206 authority, and that would leave the majority of the Municipality of Anchorage without a water and electrical power supply.\n\nNVE states in closing: “As such, we request that the Project Owners consider our proposed dam alternative to comply with the Agreement’s purposes and provide a myriad of public interest benefits, including the long-term benefit of affordable energy from truly renewable sources.”\n\nEnvironmentalists Against Hydro\n\nThe environmental stakeholders who have weaseled their way into the process are waging a full-on frontal assault against hydropower, aiming to convince people that it is not “green” and that we need to replace our firm and already paid for infrastructure with an extremely expensive and environmentally destructive building block to facilitate Green New Deal profiteering. In the twisted view of depopulationist Brad Meiklejohn: “You can’t really call Eklutna hydropower a renewable resource if you are killing off Alaska’s ultimate renewable resource, salmon.” Those salmon not being for human consumption, apparently.\n\n————–\n\nPart II tomorrow will examine the proposed solutions, past and present, to reveal major questionable ulterior motives from stakeholders and elected officials.\n\n4.5 14 votes Article Rating\n\nLike this: Like Loading...', 'en', 'Chris Hanley', '2025-01-10 00:00:00', 4, 'The article focuses on the Eklutna Hydro Dam Project and its potential impact on Alaska\'s energy infrastructure, which is the main subject of the post.

In Western Australia (WA) we have incendiary gum trees, regular droughts, and humidity so low that sometimes the clothes dry in the washing machine. Far be it for me to tell Californians how to manage their forests, but thought it worth a mention that Western Australian State govt do managed burns on 8% of the forest each year, and our top experts say it should be twice as much. Compare that to California, where the rate of prescribed burning is now around 0.2% of the forest or so. Not the same type of fire-loving trees, but still the flammable kind… BushfireFront: WA burns about 8% annually A regime of green burning also produces a healthier and more vigorous forest and is better for biodiversity. This approach was applied rigorously in WA forests for nearly 30 years, with tremendous success.

Judging by administrative steps it has taken, Peoples might also submit a rate increase request of its own, according to Illinois PIRG (Public Interest Research Group).\n\nEditorial Editorial\n\nThose are two developments that could hit us, the customers, in the wallet. As the ICC goes through the months-long process of examining Nicor’s proposal, it should insist that every extra penny the utility is asking for is fully justified.\n\nFor example, Nicor’s proposed rate hike includes a measure that would boost its authorized profit rate from 9.51% to 10.35%. That’s extra money for shareholders, but it is also an extra cost for customers — about $112 million worth each year, according to Illinois PIRG. The Citizens Utility Board called it a “money grab.”\n\nNicor said it is investing in streamlining technology and decarbonization. It has also, to its credit, pushed an energy efficiency program to reduce the amount of gas that is burned.\n\nMeanwhile, Peoples’ pipeline replacement program could double Chicago heating bills over the next 15 years, according to a CUB-commissioned study by Groundwork Data, which Peoples disputes. In 2023, the ICC paused the pipeline replacement program, but two ICC administrative law judges in November recommended Peoples resume replacing pipes, with some limits.\n\nThe idea behind the replacement project is to ensure the aging network of gas lines is safe. But critics say the program should be scaled back in a way that saves money without compromising safety.\n\nBack to the trough, again?\n\nThe estimated cost of the pipeline replacement program has soared from $1.7 billion at the start in 2007 to nearly $13 billion worth of work that still needs to be done. And that’s with less than 40% of the work completed. That’s a lot to ask of ratepayers, many of whom can’t afford the gas bills they get now.\n\nIf it seems as though the gas utilities have been coming back to the trough for more money again and again, you’re right. Nicor has requested five significant rate hikes since 2017. Peoples Gas received an increase of about $303 million in 2023.\n\nOn Monday, consumer advocates are scheduled to deliver more than 5,000 public comments about Peoples’ pipeline replacement program at the ICC’s Loop offices.\n\nAll of this is going on as the state and the industry try to figure out what the demand for gas will be in the future as Illinois tries to transition to an energy sector based more on sources that don’t involve burning fossil fuels. Last March, the ICC started “Future of Gas” workshops to develop a plan for how gas utilities will fit into that future.\n\nSetting rates for gas utilities is a complex process. Smoothly transitioning away from burning fossil fuels will be a challenge — but it’s a challenge that has to be met, given our global climate crisis.\n\nIn the meantime, the ICC should ensure gas customers don’t pay more than necessary.\n\nSend letters to letters@suntimes.com\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds.

New York and other states are already building projects and new ones could be announced as soon as this week. New York proposes getting all of its power from wind and other non-emission sources by 2040.\n\nTrump, in an hourlong briefing from Mar-a-Lago in Florida last week, derided wind-energy turbines as little more than \"garbage in a field,\" while vowing to undo recently enacted oil and gas offshore drilling bans. Trump also said he’d end electric-car mandates and even denounced electric heat while promoting \"clean natural gas\" as \"much better heat ... you don’t itch.\"\n\nTrump called wind power the \"most expensive energy ever,\" said the industry exists chiefly to enrich its developers with government subsidies and vowed to act quickly to stop future development.\n\nWHAT NEWSDAY FOUND The U.S. wind energy industry is facing severe new headwinds from Washington as a second Trump administration prepares for office, with potential ramifications for New York State and Long Island.\n\nfrom Washington as a second Trump administration prepares for office, with potential ramifications for New York State and Long Island.

Opponents point to visual impacts, loss of commercial fishing grounds and potential effects on electric rates and sea mammals.\n\nIf the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry was already experiencing severe growing pains after more than a year of canceled projects, massive cost overruns and corporate retrenchings, Trump’s comments threw into doubt the prospect that projects seeking federal permits would sail through the approval process as they have under President Joe Biden.\n\nNew York\'s plans\n\nAt a speech on Long Island Friday, Gov. Kathy Hochul noted New York has the largest federally sited offshore wind facility in the United States, with the 12-turbine, LIPA-contracted South Fork Wind farm, and said, \"We\'re just getting started.\"\n\nAsked in an interview how Trump\'s opposition to wind could set back the state\'s vision for 9,000-megwatts of wind by 2035, Hochul said she was \"happy to have a conversation with the Trump administration, especially with the [future] head of the EPA being from Long Island,\" in former Rep. Lee Zeldin. Hochul said Zeldin, of Shirley, \"should be a great champion because he knows there\'s tens of thousands of jobs that would be at risk\" were offshore wind to be stalled or stopped.\n\nEven before Trump\'s recent comments, one offshore wind developer that had proposed a project for deep waters between the coasts of Long Island and New Jersey paused it, citing \"uncertainty\" after Trump’s election. That project, called Attentive Energy 1, had proposed a cable through Long Island Sound and into a planned green-energy hub at the Ravenswood power station in Queens.\n\n\"Once again Donald Trump is asking the wrong questions and offering the wrong solutions,\" said Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of labor and environmental groups in support of clean-energy initiatives. He was referring to Trump’s unfilled promise to revive the coal industry. \"He can’t stop the wind industry, but he certainly can damage it.\"\n\nNew York, which has 130 megawatts of offshore wind powering the Long Island grid, and dozens of land-based turbine arrays upstate, has a goal of 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, with new projects that will need many federal permits expected to be announced as soon as this month. Only three New York projects have all their federal permits.\n\nProjects underway\n\nConstruction crews with Haugland Energy have been at work for months building a 17.5-mile, land-based cable for a project known as Sunrise Wind that will make landfall at Smith Point, with plans to power up in 2026.\n\nAsked for a response to Trump’s comments, Denmark-based Orsted, through a spokeswoman, would only say, \"Sunrise is under construction and we will continue to advance the project.\"\n\nOrsted has had to take some $5 billion in impairment charges for U.S. offshore wind projects and cancel two in New Jersey.\n\nThe Empire Wind project, with 54 turbines to be located 14 miles from Long Beach, has already begun work on the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal landing site, employing about 1,000 workers, developer Equinor said. The company recently announced the project will cost more than $7 billion to construct — including more than $2 billion in federal tax credits — and that offshore construction will start installing 54 monopiles driven into the seabed sometime in the April-June period.\n\nEquinor said it expects to \"farm down\" in the Empire project at some future juncture, saying it is \"actively working to bring in a new partner\" for the project, which parted ways with former partner BP last year.\n\nThe project in August received a \"no hazard to air navigation\" determination from the FAA for a turbine at the southwestern edge of the array, the final needed federal approval. The project expects to begin full commercial operation in 2027.\n\nBut some are hoping to stop it. A national day of action against offshore wind is planned by the activist group Protect Our Coast Long Island on Jan. 18. The theme for the protest, which includes a march across the Long Beach bridge, is \"End It!\"\n\nWhether Trump’s vow to enact policies to block wind energy can prevent state plans to power the grid with wind energy over the next two decades remains to be seen.\n\nThe New York State Energy Research & Development Authority, which is administering offshore wind projects in the state, in a carefully worded statement said it’s \"too early to determine how the incoming [Trump] administration will affect the growing offshore wind industry.\"\n\nThe statement noted Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind are already being built, and that New York has worked under \"different administrations at the federal level, adapting to shifting policies and priorities, and our mission remains as steadfast today as it was five decades ago.\"\n\nLooking to future\n\nAll forms of wind energy, including the South Fork project, compose about 8.94% of the state’s energy mix this month, according to the webpage of the state grid manager NYISO. Hydroelectric is 17.97%, natural gas 20.44% and nuclear 16.96%. Wind turbines produce more in winter than summer.\n\nIn the case of Attentive Energy 1, planned for the waters off Long Island and New Jersey, principal investor TotalEnergies cited uncertainties around Trump’s reelection in announcing it would pause a project that had been submitted as part of the latest New York wind solicitation in 2023, Bloomberg reported. Paris-based TotalEnergies, a gas and oil giant, had planned a project with Rise Light & Power, which owns the Ravenswood power plant and facility in Queens, and Corio Generation.\n\nClint Plummer, chief executive of Rise Light & Power, in a December interview, said despite the comments from Trump, the offshore wind industry has accomplished enough over the past decade to keep already federally permitted projects active, while future arrays may take longer to build.\n\n\"The industry in the U.S. is going to wait and see what happens with the Trump administration, but my personal view is that ... even if there are no further permits issued for the next several years, there’s still a huge pipeline of federally permitted offshore wind projects out there,\" said Plummer, who helped develop the nation’s first offshore wind farm for LIPA. \"I think it will take longer for the rest of the pipeline of projects to be developed, [though] at some point I think they will be developed.\"\n\nWith James T.

Need to act fast here. All neighbors houses burning. Will pay any amount.”\n\nThe now-deleted post sparked an intense blowback by social media users who felt the wealthy shouldn’t be given special attention during an emergency.\n\n“Whose home gets saved shouldn’t depend on their bank account,” one TikTok user commented.\n\nAs multiple wildfires, powered by high-speed winds, have destroyed thousands of homes in the Los Angeles area, some residents have gone to great lengths — and often great expense — to try to shield their homes from destruction. Some have paid thousands of dollars to get their properties sprayed with fire-retardant gels to stem the damage, while others have invested in personal fire hydrants to help fight fires near their property.\n\nDespite the intense reaction to Wasserman’s social media post, most private firefighters aren’t hired by wealthy individuals, Mike Stutts, a firefighter in Somerset, California, told CNN. Instead, most work with home insurance companies that are trying to save expensive homes to avoid costly insurance payouts.\n\nAccording to materials on its website, insurance company Chubb offers “Wildfire Defense Services” to eligible clients. During a wildfire event, those services include “sending certified professional firefighters to your home,” “removing combustible materials from around your home” and “spraying your home with a heat-absorbing fire-blocking gel.”\n\nTim Bauer, a senior vice president at fire damage restoration service Allied Disaster Defense, said after the first three days of fire in Pacific Palisades, he had a waiting list of at least 200 people, all desperate for the company’s services. Bauer said the company is spraying properties with the same fire retardant dropped by firefighting air tankers.\n\nAllied sprays down bushes, shrubs and other vegetation to prevent ashes and sparks from igniting a home.\n\nDuring non-emergency times, the cost is about $1,000, but amid dangerous wildfire conditions, Bauer charges $5,000.\n\nFor many in the affluent neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, it’s a small price to pay to help protect multimillion-dollar homes. Bauer said one woman offered $100,000 to be moved to the top of his waiting list, but Bauer said he planned to stick to the original order on his list.\n\nOn Friday, Michael Owens, a real estate developer in the Los Angeles area, showed one of his newly built homes to a family whose own home was just destroyed in the Palisades fire.\n\nThe listed price of the home in Westlake Village, which sits on the Los Angeles-Ventura county line, is nearly $15 million. One of the home’s main selling points is it’s built with fire-proof materials and comes equipped with a personal fire hydrant.\n\nAll in, the cost of the home’s personal fire hydrant is about $100,000, Owens told CNN. That includes the installation cost and a one-time $35,000 fee to the municipal water company for access. Owens said he has one in front of his own Westlake Village home, as well.\n\nOwens said he hoped the recent wildfires would convince more people to prioritize investing in fire-safe homes.\n\n“It will be interesting now, as you see homes built back in the Palisades, what people consider doing with their homes when they’re in an urban high-fire risk area,” he said.\n\nIn Malibu, a type of personal fire hydrant that costs significantly less than $100,000 has grown in popularity, said Kevin Rosenbloom, a local resident who owns a healthcare device company.\n\nRosenbloom’s home was rebuilt after it was destroyed by a wildfire in 2007. In front of his home, he built a “Hainy Hydrant,” a personal fire hydrant developed by fellow Malibu resident Matt Haines to help the area combat wildfires.\n\nRosenbloom said the hydrant cost him about $2,500, and since it taps into a home’s personal water supply, it can be installed by a plumber. Rosenbloom said his home hasn’t been hit by the recent fires, but he plans to use his personal hydrant to keep his home “cool and wet” if one approaches.\n\n“People all over Malibu have been putting these hydrants in. It’s a basic first step and it’s very inexpensive relative to other systems available,” Rosenbloom said. “This is really the next technology in fire suppression and fire protection.”\n\nEven with extra investment in firefighting and suppression systems, though, there is no guarantee a home could survive a fire as strong as the one still raging in Pacific Palisades.\n\nWasserman, who sent out the plea for private firefighters, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.', 'en', 'Samantha Delouya, Stephanie Becker', '2025-01-11 00:00:00', 2, 'The article mentions that some residents have paid to protect their homes from wildfires, which is a significant concern for the market.

Small Russian anti-submarine ship and chemical tanker at Baltic sea.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock, Ninevija\n\nGermany may have just averted an environmental catastrophe in the Baltic Sea. Tug boats have just hauled a drifting oil tanker, believed to be part of Moscow’s sneaky efforts to dodge sanctions, to the safety of calmer waters.\n\nThe Panama-flagged ‘Eventin,’ which was spotted adrift off the coast of Germany’s island of Rügen on January 10, 2025, had been floating dangerously in the Baltic Sea for several hours before it was pulled back.\n\nA specialised Bremen tugboat was dispatched to prevent a possible disaster, successfully towing the tanker to safer territory. But, as Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock pointed out, this wasn’t just a case of a rogue ship wandering off course – it was a clear threat to both European security and the region’s vital tourism industry.\n\nGreenpeace wasted no time in pointing fingers, declaring the ‘Eventin’ as part of Russia’s “shadow fleet,” a clandestine armada of aging tankers designed to slip under the radar and continue supplying oil to Moscow, all while circumventing international sanctions. These sanctions, were slapped on Russia after the country’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the Eventin’s cargo. The tanker was reportedly carrying a staggering 99,000 tons of oil, originally heading from Russia to Egypt. However, its sudden drift through the Baltic Sea raised alarm bells, as it could have caused environmental devastation if it hadn’t been caught in time.\n\nBaerbock was quick to condemn the situation, pointing out that Russia wasn’t just playing dirty with its war on Ukraine. “They’re risking European security with everything from sabotage and disinformation to dodgy, dilapidated oil tankers,” she said. “This goes beyond the battlefield – Russia’s meddling reaches the high seas, too.”\n\nCheck out more news in English from around Germany.\n\nRead more news in English from around Europe.\n\nShare this story\n\nSubscribe to our Euro Weekly News alerts to get the latest stories into your inbox!\n\nBy signing up, you will create a Euro Weekly News account if you don\'t already have one.

Bruce Westerman\n\nR-Arkansas\n\nAfter four years of countless blows to American energy production, the Biden administration has once again proven that they have no interest in putting our country and our national security first. A midnight ruling proved that this administration has no desire to work toward American energy dominance as a ban on oil and gas production in more than 600 million acres of federal waters was announced earlier this week.\n\nAmerica will always need the oil and gas industry. Yet, the Biden administration has continually relied on our adversaries to provide energy – not domestic producers. At the end of the day, this is not just sending our adversaries American dollars for the goods they provide, but ultimately handing them full control over the safety of our economy and well-being.\n\nThe reckless decision in the early days of the Biden administration to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline permit and oil and gas leasing on federal lands was especially disastrous to the hardworking Americans who found themselves immediately out of a job and the means to provide for their families. Our nation was also shortchanged by the deprivation of a major investment which could have proven to boost the American economy exponentially. It’s unfortunate that once again, a similar decision was made with a single stroke of a pen at the expense of the American people.\n\nEnergy security is national security, and when we have the ability to produce our own energy right here in or backyard, create thousands of jobs for Americans, and take back the control we have so thoughtlessly handed to countries like Russia and China, we are giving the American people a win and ensuring our dominance in the energy sector across the globe.\n\nThat’s why, as Chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, I sent a letter to President Biden and Secretary of the Interior, Debra Haaland, to strongly condemn this decision which betrays decades of progress, abandoning hard working Americans who rely on offshore energy development for their livelihoods in the process. In my letter, I remind President Biden and Secretary Haaland that history will remember this decision not as a triumph of conservation, but as a retreat to radicalism – a misguided attempt to cement a legacy of obstruction at the expense of America’s energy security.\n\nI have made it a top priority as we enter the 119th Congress to fight for America-first energy production and reverse Biden’s reckless and unsustainable policies, and I intend to do so until America is once again the global leader in energy production.\n\n••• Publisher\'s note: A free press is critical to having well-informed voters and citizens.

Those struggling to keep their homes warm could be eligible for financial aid and support with the cost of replacing essential household energy appliances.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nAlastair Douglas, chief executive of TotallyMoney, said: \"A warm home shouldn\'t be a luxury, but it\'s fast becoming that.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe highlighted the recent surge in energy costs, stating: \"Energy bills have just been hiked again, and we\'ve been told to expect more rises in April. Costs are now almost double what they were before the crisis, and many might be wondering what they can do to reduce the burden.\"\n\n‌\n\n\n\nMr Douglas urged those having difficulty heating their homes to get in touch with their suppliers promptly. He added: \"If you\'re struggling to keep up with your bills, then get in touch with your supplier as soon as possible. They should be able to work out a plan which works for you both, whether that means setting up a payment plan or giving you some breathing space.\"\n\nFurthermore, Mr Douglas mentioned that the big six UK energy suppliers have established energy funds for their customers, saying: \"If eligible, they might help you to manage your energy bills, or clear all or part of your balance,\" reports the Express.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nHe also noted that some suppliers offer additional support such as blankets or upgrades to home insulation and boilers.\n\nBritish Gas customers facing difficulties with their gas and electricity bills can apply to the company\'s energy support fund. This scheme matches 100% of every payment made into an energy account for a six-month period.\n\nTo qualify, customers must agree to a regular monthly Direct Debit payment for six months. For instance, if you pay £50 a month for six consecutive months, British Gas will also deposit £50 into your energy account each month, totalling £300.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nEDF customers can access its customer support fund, which offers debt assistance and energy-efficient appliances like cookers, fridges, and washing machines to replace old or faulty models. EDF also provides smaller items to help keep customers warm during the colder months.\n\nTo be eligible, you\'ll need proof of benefits and/or tax credits received by adults in your household, as well as evidence of any illnesses diagnosed by a doctor or medical professional. E.ON customers, including those of Sainsbury\'s Energy experiencing financial hardship, can apply to the E.ON next energy fund for aid. This can include providing a replacement appliance such as a cooker, fridge, fridge-freezer or washing machine if yours is broken or in poor condition.\n\nOctopus Energy\'s customer help fund, Octo Assist, is a £30 million scheme that includes a collection of support initiatives designed to assist customers who need it most in managing their energy and staying warm without worry. The fund also provides free electric blankets, Winter Fuel Payments, standing charge waivers, and more.\n\n‌\n\n\n\nOVO Energy\'s extra support fund, OVO Extra Support, is a £50m fund which has aided over 200,000 customers in managing and paying for their energy over the past year. The Scottish Power Hardship Fund can also assist by clearing or reducing outstanding balances for Scottish Power customers who are on a lower income and struggling to pay their energy bills.\n\nGovernment assistance for heating includes the Winter Fuel Payment, which provides a one-off payment of £300 to those who have reached state pension age to contribute towards heating costs - but only if they qualify. The Household Support Fund was introduced to aid vulnerable households in managing the cost of living crisis.\n\nThis government programme financially assists Brits who are struggling to pay for food, energy, and water bills, among other things.

He further noted that trial shipments have already been completed successfully.\n\nThis potential agreement follows previous successful negotiations at the Kazan Forum. In 2023, a contract was signed for the annual transit of 50 million tons of Russian oil, and in 2024, a deal for the transit of 2 million tons of Russian wheat and flour was established.\n\nThe Kazan Forum, a key platform for economic cooperation between Russia and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries, continues to play a vital role in fostering regional trade and development.\n\nThe upcoming forum is expected to further strengthen economic ties between Russia and Afghanistan, particularly in the energy sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Abdul Salam Jawad Akhundzada, stated that initial steps have been taken for signing this contract.\n\n“Fortunately, the groundwork for a final agreement has been laid.

When they do that with Warren Buffett\'s portfolio of stocks, owned within his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.94%)(BRK.B 0.83%), they\'ll find a collection of iconic companies. Two that present very different investment propositions today are American Express (AXP 0.51%) and Chevron (CVX +1.58%). While these two companies are very different, that dichotomy might be the biggest selling point for Chevron.\n\nWhat do American Express and Chevron do?\n\nAmerican Express hails from the finance sector, describing itself as a globally integrated \"payments\" company. That\'s a pretty vague description. What most people will know American Express for is its namesake credit card. It competes with the likes of Mastercard and Visa. But there\'s a nuance here because American Express has long focused on higher-end customers. Such customers often spend more and are more resilient to economic volatility, leading to a fairly strong business foundation for this card issuer. So, the fees it collects for processing transactions are highly reliable over time.\n\nExpand NYSE : AXP American Express Today\'s Change ( -0.51 %) $ -1.85 Current Price $ 357.74 Key Data Points Market Cap $248B Day\'s Range $ 355.98 - $ 360.85 52wk Range $ 220.43 - $ 387.49 Volume 117K Avg Vol 2.6M Gross Margin 61.04 % Dividend Yield 0.91 %\n\nChevron couldn\'t be more different. It operates in the energy sector with a globally diversified portfolio of oil and natural gas production, transportation, and processing assets. Having exposure to the entire energy sector, from the upstream (production) to the downstream (processing), helps to soften the ups and downs, but Chevron\'s top and bottom lines are still going to track along with energy prices. Energy prices are prone to dramatic and swift swings.\n\nWhich is better: American Express or Chevron?\n\nFrom a big-picture perspective, conservative investors looking at Warren Buffett\'s portfolio will probably prefer American Express\' business model. That said, there\'s a small fly in the ointment here. Since late 2023, American Express\' share price has roughly doubled. That is a substantial advance in a very short period of time for such a large company.\n\nExpand NYSE : CVX Chevron Today\'s Change ( 1.58 %) $ 2.56 Current Price $ 164.90 Key Data Points Market Cap $327B Day\'s Range $ 163.33 - $ 165.90 52wk Range $ 132.04 - $ 168.96 Volume 190K Avg Vol 8.8M Gross Margin 13.60 % Dividend Yield 4.21 %\n\nAt this point, American Express looks expensive in terms of all of the traditional valuation measures. To put some numbers on that, the company\'s price-to-sales ratio is 3.3x versus a five-year average of 2.5x, and its price-to-earnings ratio is 22x versus a longer-term average of roughly 18x. While it would be understandable if investors liked American Express\' business model, with its annuity-like revenue stream, it would be hard to suggest that the entry price is attractive right now, noting that the 0.9% dividend yield is near its lowest levels of the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the other hand, Chevron is offering a dividend yield of 4.4%. While that yield has been higher in the past, notably during the deep oil downturn that occurred during the coronavirus pandemic, the yield has been in the top half of the range over the past decade. And, notably, Chevron\'s stock hasn\'t doubled in price in roughly a year. In fact, the stock has gone mostly nowhere.\n\nWhile oil prices are the driving force at Chevron, long-term income investors have been well rewarded for sticking around just the same. The energy giant has increased its dividend annually for 37 consecutive years. That shows management knows how to navigate the sector\'s inherent volatility. And while there\'s no way to predict oil prices, if you are looking for a dividend stock and don\'t want to overpay, Chevron seems like a more attractive choice than American Express right now.\n\nDo your own homework\n\nWarren Buffett has an incredible investment record, but he isn\'t always right. Just because he owns a stock today doesn\'t mean he would buy it at the current price. So, you shouldn\'t just look at his list of holdings and start picking stocks. You need to dig in a little bit further. American Express is a good example of what you can end up with if you don\'t, given that it looks expensive right now. On the other hand, Chevron could be an attractive dividend stock, given its high yield and long history of dividend increases.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the ships – nearly 50 years old – “shouldn’t have been in operation at all.”\n\nThose two tankers carried around 10,000 tons of fuel between them – 10 times less than the Eventin.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLater in December, Finnish authorities seized a tanker traveling from Russia, on suspicion it had used its anchor to damage an undersea power cable connecting Finland and Estonia.\n\nGerman authorities said no oil leaks had been detected after the Eventin lost power on Friday, but warned of strong winds and waves of up to 2.5 meters (over 8 feet).\n\nZelensky called the tanker “an oil bomb that, fortunately, didn’t detonate.”\n\n“Every day, Russia bombards Ukraine, and it finances its missiles, strike drones, and guided bombs, in part, with profits from its tanker fleet. Russia jeopardizes the environment solely to sustain its ability to kill people,” he said Friday.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAlso on Friday, the outgoing Biden administration targeted Russia’s energy sector, including its so-called “shadow fleet,” with some of its harshest sanctions to date. Zelensky welcomed the move.\n\nThe sanctions target nearly 200 oil-carrying vessels, many thought to be part of the fleet. A senior administration official said: “We expect our actions to cost Russia upwards of billions of dollars per month.”\n\nIn December 2022, the Group of Seven (G7) nations capped the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel. The cap was designed to be enforced by companies that provide shipping, insurance and other services for Russian oil.

This price rally has been fueled by a combination of geopolitical factors, dwindling U.S. crude stockpiles, cold weather, and uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s approach to Iranian crude exports.\n\nThe new sanctions, which specifically target more than 180 Russian oil tankers and the country’s maritime insurance sector, are expected to have a significant impact on global oil supply. These measures were larger than anticipated, sending shockwaves through the market. Indian oil refiners, in particular, are bracing for the consequences, as they have been key buyers of Russian crude, according to sources cited by Reuters.\n\nOle Hansen, head of commodities strategy at Saxo Bank, noted, “Additional sanctions against the Russian oil and insurance industry have added further fuel to the fire, raising concerns over supply shortages during a period of heightened winter demand.”\n\nThe surge in oil prices has also been supported by a decrease in U.S. crude stockpiles, lower seaborne exports from Russia, and cold weather sweeping across Europe and the U.S., which could disrupt oil supply. With rising demand for heating oil, stock draws in distillates in the coming weeks could put further strain on the market, analysts warn.\n\nPVM Oil Associates highlighted that “the cold spell in the U.S. and Europe could disrupt supply if refiners are affected,” exacerbating supply concerns. The organization also pointed to declining crude exports from Iran and Russia, forcing China to seek alternative suppliers.\n\nThe uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration’s potential actions to curtail Iranian crude exports has also added to the bullish market sentiment. As sanctions on both Russian and Iranian oil exports continue to make sourcing more difficult, Asian buyers have turned to alternative grades from the Middle East. The ongoing sanctions against these key oil producers have made it more challenging for refiners to secure stable crude supplies.\n\nCommodity strategists Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey from ING noted that the cold weather across parts of the Northern Hemisphere is likely to boost oil demand further. Moreover, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia trading at a premium to oil, the risk of substitution between the two fuels has increased.\n\nThis price spike also follows a significant decision by a major Chinese port operator to ban the docking of sanctioned Russian and Iranian tankers, further tightening global oil supply chains.', 'en', 'Sri Lanka Guardian, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow, Class, Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus, Display Inline, Sourceurl Https, Slguardian.Org Wp-Content Plugins Co-Authors-Plus Build Blocks Block-Coauthors Style-Index.Css, .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-', '2025-01-12 03:00:00', 3, '4 phrases mentionant explicitement le mécanisme pétrolier.', 64.14, 1, 'oil', '2026-01-13 19:02:20', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Oil Prices Surge 4.5% as U.S. Targets Russian Tankers and Maritime Insurance//// http://slguardian.org/oil-prices-surge-4-5-as-u-s-targets-russian-tankers-and-maritime-insurance/');

It was unprecedented, marking the first time a former or sitting US president had visited.\n\nBut it was also an extraordinary act of personal intervention, one which many believe narrowly averted a war between the US and North Korea that could have cost millions of lives. And it led to a period of greater engagement between Pyongyang and the West.\n\nAll this may not have happened if not for a set of diplomatic chess moves by Carter, who died aged 100 on 29 December.\n\n“Kim Il-sung and Bill Clinton were stumbling into a conflict, and Carter leapt into the breach, successfully finding a path for negotiated resolution of the standoff,” North Korean expert John Delury, of Yonsei University, told the BBC.\n\nIn early 1994, tensions were running high between Washington and Pyongyang, as officials tried to negotiate an end to North Korea’s nuclear programme.\n\nUS intelligence agencies suspected that despite ongoing talks, North Korea may have secretly developed nuclear weapons.\n\nThen, in a startling announcement, North Korea said it had begun withdrawing thousands of fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor for reprocessing. This violated an earlier agreement with the US under which such a move required the presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog.\n\nNorth Korea also announced it would withdraw from the IAEA.\n\nAmerican suspicion spiked as Washington believed Pyongyang was preparing a weapon, and US officials broke off negotiations. Washington began preparing several retaliatory measures, including initiating UN sanctions and reinforcing troops in South Korea.\n\nIn subsequent interviews, US officials revealed they also contemplated dropping a bomb or shooting a missile at Yongbyon – a move which they knew would have likely resulted in war on the Korean peninsula and the destruction of the South’s capital, Seoul.\n\nIt was in this febrile atmosphere that Carter made his move.\n\nFor years, he had been quietly wooed by Kim Il-sung, who had sent him personal entreaties to visit Pyongyang. In June 1994, upon hearing Washington’s military plans, and following discussions with his contacts in the US government and China – North Korea’s main ally – Carter decided to finally accept Kim’s invitation.\n\n“I think we were on the verge of war,” he told the US public broadcaster PBS years later. “It might very well have been a second Korean War, within which a million people or so could have been killed, and a continuation of the production of nuclear fissile material… if we hadn’t had a war.”\n\nCarter’s visit was marked by skillful diplomatic footwork – and brinkmanship.\n\nFirst, Carter had to test Kim’s sincerity. He made a series of requests, all of which were agreed to, except the last: Carter wanted to travel to Pyongyang from Seoul across the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a strip of land that acts as a buffer between the two Koreas.\n\n“Their immediate response was that no-one had ever done this for the last 43 years, that even the United Nations secretary-general had to go to Pyongyang through Beijing. And I said, ‘Well, I’m not going, then’,” he said.\n\nA week later, Kim caved.\n\nThe next step for Carter was harder – convincing his own government to let him go. Robert Gallucci, the chief US negotiator with North Korea at the time, later said there was “discomfort in almost all quarters” about the US essentially “subcontracting its foreign policy” to a former president.\n\nCarter first sought permission from the State Department, who blanked him. Unfazed, he decided to simply inform then-US president Bill Clinton that he was going, no matter what.\n\nHe had an ally in vice-president Al Gore, who intercepted Carter’s communication to Clinton. “[Al Gore] called me on the phone and told me if I would change the wording from “I’ve decided to go” to “I’m strongly inclined to go” that he would try to get permission directly from Clinton… he called me back the next morning and said that I had permission to go.”\n\nThe trip was on.\n\n‘Very serious doubts’\n\nOn 15 June 1994, Carter crossed over to North Korea, accompanied by his wife Rosalyn, a small group of aides and a TV crew.\n\nMeeting Kim was a moral dilemma for Carter.\n\n“I had despised Kim Il-sung for 50 years. I was in a submarine in the Pacific during the Korean War, and many of my fellow servicemen were killed in that war, which I thought was precipitated unnecessarily by him,” he told PBS.\n\n“And so I had very serious doubts about him. When I arrived, though, he treated me with great deference. He was obviously very grateful that I had come.”\n\nOver several days, the Carters had meetings with Kim, were taken on a sightseeing tour of Pyongyang and went on a cruise on a luxury yacht owned by Kim’s son, Kim Jong-il.\n\nCarter discovered his hunch was right: North Korea not only feared a US military strike on Yongbyon, but was also ready to mobilise.\n\n“I asked [Kim’s advisers] specifically if they had been making plans to go to war. And they responded very specifically, ‘Yes, we were’,” he said.\n\n“North Korea couldn’t accept the condemnation of their country and the embarrassment of their leader and that they would respond.\n\n“And I think this small and self-sacrificial country and the deep religious commitments that you had, in effect, to their revered leader, their Great Leader as they called him, meant that they were willing to make any sacrifice of massive deaths in North Korea in order to preserve their integrity and their honour, which would have been a horrible debacle in my opinion.”\n\nCarter presented a list of demands from Washington as well as his own suggestions. They included resuming negotiations with the US, starting direct peace talks with South Korea, a mutual withdrawal of military forces, and helping the US find remains of US soldiers buried in North Korean territory.\n\n“He agreed to all of them. And so, I found him to be very accommodating,” Carter said. “So far as I know then and now, he was completely truthful with me.”\n\nCrucially, Carter came up with a deal where North Korea would stop its nuclear activity, allow IAEA inspectors back into its reactors, and eventually dismantle Yongbyon’s facilities. In return, the US and its allies would build light-water reactors in North Korea, which could generate nuclear energy but not produce material for weapons.\n\nWhile enthusiastically embraced by Pyongyang, the deal was met with reluctance from US officials when Carter suggested it in a phone call. He then told them he was going on CNN to announce details of the deal – leaving the Clinton administration little choice but to agree.\n\nCarter would later justify forcing his own government’s hand by saying he had to “consummate a resolution of what I considered to be a very serious crisis”. But it did not go down well back home – officials were unhappy at Carter’s “freelancing” and attempt to “box in” Clinton, according to Mr Gallucci.\n\nNear the end of the trip, they told him to convey a statement to the North Koreans, reiterating Clinton’s public position that the US was continuing to press for UN sanctions. Carter disagreed, according to reports at that time.\n\nHours later, he got on the boat with Kim, and promptly went off-script. As TV cameras rolled, he told Kim the US had stopped work on drafting UN sanctions – directly contradicting Clinton.\n\nAn annoyed White House swiftly disowned Carter. Some openly expressed frustration, painting a picture of a former president going rogue. “Carter is hearing what he wants to hear… he is creating his own reality,” a senior official complained at the time to The Washington Post.\n\nMany in Washington also criticised him for the deal itself, saying the North Koreans had used him.\n\nBut Carter’s savvy use of the news media to pressure the Clinton administration worked. By broadcasting his negotiations almost instantaneously, he gave the US government little time to react, and immediately after his trip “it was possible to see an almost hour-by-hour evolution in US policy towards North Korea” where they ratcheted down their tone, wrote CNN reporter Mike Chinoy who covered Carter’s trip.\n\nThough Carter later claimed he had misspoken on the sanctions issue, he also responded with typical stubbornness to the blowback.\n\n“When I got back to Seoul, I was amazed and distressed at the negative reaction that I had from the White House. They urged me not to come to Washington to give a briefing, urged me to go directly to… my home,” he said.\n\nBut he went against their wishes.\n\n“I decided that what I had to offer was too important to ignore.”\n\nA final dramatic coda to the episode happened a month later.\n\nOn 9 July 1994, on the same day as US and North Korean officials sat down in Geneva to talk, state media flashed a stunning announcement: Kim Il-sung had died of a heart attack.\n\nCarter’s deal was immediately plunged into uncertainty. But negotiators ploughed through, and weeks later hammered out a formal plan known as the Agreed Framework.\n\nThough the agreement broke down in 2003, it was notable for freezing Pyongyang’s nuclear programme for nearly a decade.\n\n‘Carter had guts’\n\nRobert Carlin, a former CIA and US state department official who led delegations in negotiations with North Korea, noted that Carter’s real achievement was in getting the US government to co-operate.\n\n“Carter was, more or less, pushing on an open door in North Korea. It was Washington that was the bigger challenge… if anything, Carter’s intervention helped stop the freight train of US decision-making that was hurtling toward a cliff,” he told the BBC.\n\nCarter’s visit was also significant for opening a path for rapprochement, which led to several trips later, including one in 2009 when he travelled with Clinton to bring home captured US journalists.\n\nHe is also credited with paving the way for Donald Trump’s summit with Kim Jong Un – Kim Il-sung’s grandson – in 2018, as “Carter made it imaginable” that a sitting US president could meet with a North Korean leader, Dr Delury said.\n\nThat summit failed, and of course, in the long run Carter’s trip did not succeed in removing the spectre of nuclear war, which has only grown – these days North Korea has missiles regarded as capable of hitting the US mainland.\n\nBut Carter was lauded for his political gamble. It was in sharp contrast to his time in office, when he was criticised for being too passive on foreign policy, particularly with his handling of the Iran hostage crisis.\n\nHis North Korea trip “was a remarkable example of constructive diplomatic intervention by a former leader,” Dr Delury said.\n\nHis legacy is not without controversy, given the criticism that he took matters in his own hands. His detractors believe he played a risky and complicated game by, as CNN’s Mike Chinoy put it, “seeking to circumvent what he viewed as a mistaken and dangerous US policy by pulling the elements of a nuclear deal together himself”.\n\nBut others believe Carter was the right man for the job at the time.\n\nHe had “a very strong will power”, but was also “a man of peace inside and out,” said Han S Park, one of several people who helped Carter broker the 1994 trip.\n\nThough his stubbornness also meant that he “did not get along with a lot of people”, ultimately this combination of attributes meant he was the best person “to prevent another occurrence of a Korean War”, Prof Park said.\n\nMore than anything, Carter was convinced he was doing the right thing.\n\n“He didn’t let US government clucking and handwringing stop him,” says Robert Carlin. “Carter had guts.”', 'en', 'Christina Macpherson', '2025-01-12 00:00:00', 3, 'Forte pertinence (choc majeur ou immédiat sur les prix)', 65.76, 1, 'energy', '2026-01-13 19:02:20', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'When Carter met Kim – and stopped a nuclear war//// https://nuclear-news.net/2025/01/12/2-a-when-carter-met-kim-and-stopped-a-nuclear-war/'),

It says all the tankers on the list are old and many have technical defects.\n\nLithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys also reacted to the incident, saying he favored more decisive action against Russia\'s shadow fleet.\n\n\"The Baltic Sea is the most important gateway for Russia\'s oil exports and we must stop this,\" he said during a visit to the Estonian capital Tallinn.\n\nAt the same time, the \"shadow fleet\" is an \"instrument in hybrid activities\" and poses a threat to the environment, he said.\n\nGermany\'s Central Command for Maritime Emergencies (CCME) said the vessel, which is carrying almost 100,000 tons of oil, experienced an engine failure on January 10 and \"was drifting at low speed\" off the island of Ruegen.\n\nAn emergency tug intercepted the Eventin to stabilize the ship and was joined by two tugboats that successfully attached towing lines to the stricken vessel and held it in place, the German command said.\n\nNo oil leaks were detected by surveillance aircraft, and a spokesman for the CCME quoted by the dpa news agency said the vessel did not pose an immediate environmental risk or a danger to the crew on board.\n\nNo decision has been made on whether to tow the ship to a port.\n\nSince Moscow\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022, Western countries have taken steps to reduce oil revenues that Russia has used to fund the war.

It is also the largest energy project in Turkey\'s history. On January 4, Rosatom boss Alexey Likhachev made serious accusations against the German supplier and referred to German industrial giant Siemens, even though he was actually talking about another company, Siemens Energy.\n\n\"We have noticed media reports about this, but we do not currently have a lawsuit,\" Siemens Energy\'s spokesperson Tim Proll-Gerwe told DW.\n\nRosatom chief Likhachev has accused Germany\'s Siemens Energy of delaying construction in Turkey Image: Alexander Ryumin/ITAR-TASS/imago images\n\nSiemens Energy was previously the energy technology division of Siemens, but in 2020 it became an independent company and was listed on the stock exchange. Siemens currently owns 17% of Siemens Energy.\n\nProll-Gerwe confirmed that Siemens Energy was supposed to supply gas-insulated equipment for the nuclear plant\'s power distribution system, critical equipment needed to connect it to the Turkish power grid.\n\nThe contract to do so was signed with the Russian company Elektroavtomatika in 2020, two years before Russia\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to its website, the St. Petersburg-headquartered company is a regular Rosatom supplier.\n\nExport permissions granted\n\nSiemens Energy had been waiting a \"long time\" for export permissions from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control, or BAFA, Proll-Gerwe told DW, adding that the company adheres to all local regulations.\n\nThe necessary permits for exporting the components have, in the meantime, been obtained, Proll-Gerwe said, adding that Siemens Energy could meet its contractual obligations in Akkuyu \"if the customer still wants.\"\n\nHowever, substitute products have apparently already been found for the delayed Siemens Energy components, and Rosatom could be seeking compensation for its losses. That\'s what Likhachev seemed to allude to in comments about additional expenses and the \"adjustment of installation dates\" for the power plant.\n\nIt appears the Russian firm would like to blame construction delays in Turkey at least partially on Siemens Energy and on German bureaucracy. The contract for the construction of nuclear power plants in Turkey was first signed in 2010. The cornerstone for the first section of the plant was laid in 2018, and the first reactor is supposed to go online, at the earliest, this year. The whole project is supposed to be finished by 2028.\n\nThe substitute components in Turkey appear to be Chinese. Last September, Turkish Energy Minister Alparslan Bayraktar said Rosatom had ordered alternative parts from China. According to Russian news agency Interfax, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak explained that substitute components had been purchased from \"friendly countries\" and that some had already reached the power plant in Akkuyu.\n\nIn the time it took for German authorities to approve the exports, permission to export other equipment was granted much faster, German news outlet ntv reported in September 2024.\n\nThe contract between Rosatom and Turkey was first signed in May 2010 by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev (left) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan Image: Burhan Ozbilici/AP Photo/picture alliance\n\nSecurity issues?\n\nBut is it permissible for German companies to work with Russian businesses in a sector as sensitive as nuclear energy, given current tensions between Russia and the European Union?\n\n\"Siemens Energy ended all activities in Russia earlier and no longer has any contractual relationships there,\" Siemens Energy spokesperson Proll-Gerwe told DW. \"Siemens Energy now only has to fulfill older, outstanding contracts, concluded before the start of the war in Ukraine. But, of course, this should always take place in accordance with any applicable sanctions and export control restrictions.\"\n\nThe Akkuyu nuclear power plant is in southern Turkey, sitting directly on the Mediterranean coast Image: DHA\n\nIf BAFA has now issued an export license, it means Siemens Energy\'s equipment delivery to the Turkish nuclear power plant violates neither German export rules nor EU sanctions on Russia.\n\nIt seems unlikely, however, that Rosatom would replace Chinese deliveries with the delayed German equipment. So, there is a chance Siemens Energy could end up in court across from the Russian energy firm.\n\nThis story was originally published in Russian.', 'en', 'Andrey Gurkov', NULL, 3, '2 phrases mentionant explicitement le mécanisme pétrolier', 67.27, 1, 'energy', '2026-01-13 19:02:20', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Germany\'s Siemens Energy in legal spat with Russia\'s Rosatom//// https://www.dw.com/en/russias-rosatom-threatens-to-sue-germanys-siemens-energy/a-71258707');

DataGreen, another French firm, aims to build smaller, greener data centers that run on renewable energy, saving tech companies money by reducing data storage costs.\n\nCloud computing giants have so far shown no interest, DataGreen’s AI head Julien Choukroun said.\n\n“For now, they don’t see the point, but we’re trying to convince them,” Choukroun said.\n\nThe company won an innovation award at CES this year, its first appearance at the show, and Choukroun said its services are essential.\n\n“We can’t continue to increase the hangar space [of data centers],” he said, stressing the land available “is not infinite.”\n\nHe voiced confidence that once Big Tech realizes DataGreen offers cost savings, that would “be more persuasive than the ‘green’” aspect.\n\nJordan Huyghe, product manager at the French firm Otrera, which designs small nuclear reactors, said a major change in the relationship between tech and the energy sector would require investment from giants such as Amazon.com Inc, Google or Microsoft Corp. Amazon is already the world’s largest purchaser of renewable energy.\n\nIn September last year, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy Corp to reopen the Three Mile Island power plant in Pennsylvania.

Despite this, the country’s Foreign Ministry said Russia would continue pursuing major oil and gas projects.\n\nThe ministry condemned Washington’s “hostile” actions, announced on Jan. 10, and noted that Russia would craft its foreign policy strategy in response. The ministry argued the sanctions represented “an attempt to inflict at least some damage to the Russian economy, even at the cost of the risk of destabilising world markets as the end approaches of President Joe Biden’s inglorious tenure in power.”\n\nThe sanctions mark the most extensive U.S. measures yet against Russia’s oil and gas revenue streams.

Even on this crisp winter morning, the difference is palpable.\n\nFor decades, Iraq\'s economic lifeline -- the oil and gas sector -- has come at a steep environmental cost. The practice of gas flaring, where associated gas from oil production is burned off into the atmosphere, has cast a shadow, both literal and figurative, over cities like Basra, where residents have long suffered the consequences of industrial pollution.\n\nBut a series of ambitious environmental projects, led by Chinese enterprises and dubbed the \"Blue Sky Projects\" by the locals, is helping Iraq turn a corner in its battle against pollution while addressing chronic energy shortages.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is the Basra Natural Gas Liquids (BNGL) project, a facility that captures and processes associated gas from three major oilfields. The project, built by China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), stands as a testament to what\'s possible when modern technology meets environmental consciousness.\n\n\"Every cubic meter of gas we process is one that won\'t be directly flared into Basra\'s skies,\" says Sun Baojun, the project manager, whose facility now produces enough dry gas to power nearby communities that have long struggled with electricity shortages. The numbers are impressive: 4.4 million cubic meters of dry gas and 2,600 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas daily.\n\nIn the sprawling al-Rumaila oilfield, where antiquated flare stacks once spewed black smoke into the air, change is visible. New low-pressure flaring systems are replacing the old \"candlestick\" flares, part of an upgrade project scheduled for completion by February 2025.\n\n\"By then, Basra\'s skies will be bluer, and the air even cleaner,\" says Wang Jingyang, who manages the upgrade project. His optimism reflected the broader mood of transformation in the region.\n\nThe initiative extends beyond gas processing. In a country blessed with abundant sunlight, Chinese engineers are helping Iraq harness solar power. A new one-megawatt solar station in the al-Rumaila oilfield, complete with energy storage systems, represents Iraq\'s steps toward renewable energy. The facility is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,600 tonnes annually -- a small but significant step in the country\'s environmental journey.\n\nWang Xianghui, senior vice president of CPECC Middle East Branch, emphasizes that embracing green development is a fundamental social responsibility for companies contributing to the high-quality advancement of the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\n\"We aim to play our part in building a \'Green Silk Road,\'\" he concluded.\n\nFor Iraqi officials, these developments signal a new chapter in the nation\'s industrial development. At the inauguration ceremony of the BNGL project, Oil Minister Hayan Abdul Ghani emphasized how these projects are not just environmental victories but economic ones, improving both livelihoods and air quality.\n\nThe World Bank estimates that Iraq wastes approximately 17 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually through flaring -- a stark reminder of both the challenge and the opportunity ahead. However, for residents like Hussein, the impact of these changes is measured in everyday moments: the simple pleasure of breathing cleaner air during a morning commute, a small but significant sign of progress in a city working to balance industrial might with environmental responsibility.\n\n(Tian Qingwei contributes to the report.)', 'en', 'Duan Minfu', '2025-01-13 00:00:00', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 69.55, 1, 'oil', '2026-01-13 19:02:20', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Feature: Chinese company\'s \"Blue Sky Projects\" help Iraq\'s oil-rich Basra clear its air//// https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/01/13/feature-chinese-company039s-blue-sky-projects-help-iraq039s-oil-rich-basra-clear-its-air'),

The pro-European coalition government has yet to approve a calendar for the election, although party leaders agreed to hold the two rounds on 4 and 18 May.\n\nIohannis, whose term expired on 21 December, will stay on until his successor is elected.\n\nOn Sunday, tens of thousands of protesters, including left-wingers and those angered by the way the election was cancelled, joined the protest organised by the opposition hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), Romania’s second-largest party.\n\n“We ask for a return to democracy by resuming the election with the second round,” AUR leader George Simion told reporters.\n\nOrganisers said 100,000 people were at the protest, but riot police along the march estimated the numbers at around 20,000.\n\nTrump’s Ukraine envoy calls for ‘maximum pressure’ on Iran\n\nThe world must return to a policy of “maximum pressure” against Iran to turn it into a more democratic country, US President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, told an Iranian opposition event in Paris on Saturday.\n\nTrump has vowed to return to the policy he pursued in his previous term that sought to wreck Iran’s economy to force the country to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme, ballistic missile programme and regional activities.\n\n“These pressures are not just kinetic, just not military force, but they must be economic and diplomatic as well,” retired Lieutenant-General Kellogg, who is set to serve as Trump’s special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, told the audience at Paris-based Iranian opposition group National Council of Resistance of Iran.\n\nHe said there was an opportunity “to change Iran for the better” but that this opportunity would not last forever.\n\n“We must exploit the weakness we now see. The hope is there, so must too be the action.”\n\nTougher US sanctions to curb Russian oil supply to China, India\n\nChinese and Indian refiners will source more oil from the Middle East, Africa and the Americas, boosting prices and freight costs, as new US sanctions on Russian producers and ships curb supplies to Moscow’s top customers, said traders and analysts.\n\nThe US Treasury on Friday imposed sanctions on Russian oil producers Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, as well as 183 vessels that have shipped Russian oil, targeting the revenues Moscow has used to fund its war with Ukraine.\n\nMany of the tankers have been used to ship oil to India and China as Western sanctions and a price cap imposed by the Group of Seven countries in 2022 shifted trade in Russian oil from Europe to Asia. Some tankers have also shipped oil from Iran, which is also under sanctions.\n\nRussian oil exports will be hurt severely by the new sanctions, which will force Chinese independent refiners to cut refining output going forward, said two Chinese trade sources.\n\nAmong the newly sanctioned ships, 143 are oil tankers that handled more than 530 million barrels of Russian crude last year, about 42% of the country’s total seaborne crude exports, said Kpler’s lead freight analyst, Matt Wright, in a note.\n\nOf these, about 300 million barrels were shipped to China while the bulk of the remainder went to India, he added.\n\n“These sanctions will significantly reduce the fleet of ships available to deliver crude from Russia in the short term, pushing freight rates higher,” said Wright.\n\nHungary planned to hold talks with regional allies to counter the impact of higher oil prices resulting from the new round of US sanctions on Russia’s oil and gas sector, said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on Sunday.\n\nSlovak Parliament’s Deputy Speaker arrives in Moscow\n\nSlovak Deputy Speaker of Parliament Andrej Danko arrived in Moscow on Sunday, reported Russian state-run Tass news agency, as Bratislava seeks a solution following Ukraine’s decision to halt Russian gas pipeline deliveries to Europe.\n\nDanko’s visit, planned before the gas dispute, would continue until Wednesday, reported Tass and Slovak news agency TASRd.\n\nOn Friday, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said that Russian President Vladimir Putin promised that Russia’s state gas company Gazprom would find alternative ways to deliver contracted gas to Slovakia after the end of transit through Ukraine.\n\nUkraine, which has been at war with Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion, refused to renew a transit deal with Russia as it seeks to cut revenues going to Moscow to fund the war.\n\nRussia says it takes control of two villages in eastern Ukraine\n\nRussian troops had taken control of the villages of Yantarne in the Donetsk region and Kalynove in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine, said the Russian Defence Ministry on Sunday.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm battlefield reports.\n\nSeparately, the ministry said that over the past 24 hours, Russian forces had carried out strikes on Ukrainian military airfields, personnel and vehicles in 139 locations using its air force, drones, missiles and artillery.\n\nUkraine captures two North Korean soldiers in Kursk\n\nUkraine had captured two North Korean soldiers in Russia’s Kursk region, said Zelensky on Saturday, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the war last autumn.\n\nNorth Korean regular troops entered the war on Russia’s side in October, according to Kyiv and its Western allies, who initially estimated their numbers at 10,000 or more.\n\nIn a post on X, Zelensky said that the soldiers had been brought to Kyiv and were communicating with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), the country’s domestic intelligence agency.\n\n“As with all prisoners of war, these two North Korean soldiers are receiving the necessary medical assistance,” said Zelensky. He said that journalists would be given access to speak to them.\n\nKyiv says that North Korean troops are fighting in the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an incursion in August.

In its latest weekly report, shipbroker Gibson highlighted that “earlier this week, news emerged that one of the major port operators in China’s Shandong Province, Shandong Port Group (SPG), would ban the entry of vessels which appear on the United States OFAC sanctions list. Given the fact that independent refiners in the province are the largest receivers of Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian crude, the impact could be significant. Looking at 2024 trade to the ports within SPG’s remit, it becomes possible to get a sense of what sectors might see the greatest impact”.\n\nAccording to Gibson, “firstly, it is important to note that SPG does not control all ports in Shandong Province, however, according to their website, they control major ports including Qingdao, Rizhao, Yantai, Dongying, Binzhou and Weifang, which together accounted for 2.4mbd out of the 3.3mbd of crude imported into the province in 2024. Secondly, it is somewhat unclear if all terminals within these ports fall under SPG’s remit, and thus are now unable to receive OFAC sanctioned ships. Nevertheless, given the scale of imports into SPG ports, the potential impact is sizeable. Looking at trade data, of the 2.4mbd of crude heading to these ports last year, approximately 1.1mbd of crude originated from Iran, Venezuela or Russia. However, given attempts by Iran and Venezuela to disguise the origin of their crude, the actual figures could be higher”.\n\nThe shipbroker added that “Iranian crude flows into China are likely to be most impacted, with 67% of the vessels tracked shipping Iranian crude to SPG ports last year featuring on the OFAC list, including 42 VLCCs, 8 Suezmaxes and 1 Aframax, which had been trading to SPG ports, but will now be unable to do so. The impact on Venezuelan flows for now looks much more limited. Just one OFAC sanctioned Aframax was tracked shipping Venezuelan crude to China in 2024. Whilst this looks suspiciously low, perhaps it suggests more sophisticated evasion tactics. The impact on Russian flows is more sizeable, as 43 OFAC listed Aframaxes and Suezmaxes with Russian crude onboard visited SPG ports last year, with the majority of Russia to China trade heading to non SPG ports. The Biden administration issued further sanctions against Russia today, and the incoming Trump Administration is also expected to step up sanctions against its adversaries”.\n\n“So how impactful will the ban be? Based on the current sanctions list, VLCCs on the Iran to China trade are likely to be the most impacted sector, with 42 VLCCs which had been trading to SPG ports now unable to do so. Aframaxes and Suezmaxes impacted on the Russia to China trade number stands at 43, however, this is a smaller share of the overall (dark) fleet for these sizes. It is unclear to what extent these vessels could be diverted to different terminals. We could also see these vessels “swapped” with those which are yet to be sanctioned by OFAC, with the sanctioned ships moving into other parts of the Russian and Iranian oil supply chain. STS activity could also be used to ensure the final delivery leg is conducted on non-sanctioned ships. Overall, we count 344 LR2/Aframaxes, 149 Suezmaxes, and 194 VLCCs undertaking illicit activity, suggesting at least to some extent that these vessels can be swapped, provided they are not on the OFAC list (a total of 89 VLCCs are currently OFAC sanctioned)”, Gibson said.\n\nThe shipbroker concluded that “for the mainstream oil and tanker market, the hope is that the new port ban provides another barrier to trading sanctioned crude and ships, shifting demand from “dark” to “light”. It also reinforces an emerging (and still to be confirmed) trend of buyers shying away from sanctioned crudes due to fear of tougher sanctions from the incoming US Administration. Whilst it may be difficult to gauge the magnitude of the development, it is hard to see anything but upside for the mainstream tanker market”.\n\nNikos Roussanoglou, Hellenic Shipping News Worldwide', 'en', NULL, NULL, 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 67.88, 1, 'tanker', '2026-01-13 19:02:20', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Geopolitics and Sanctions: Tanker Market Navigating Turbulent Waters at the Start of 2025//// https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/geopolitics-and-sanctions-tanker-market-navigating-turbulent-waters-at-the-start-of-2025/'),

I think this thing started at just over US$900 million and I think it has gone way past US$1B, so the figures are showing it is already going up.”\n\nThe GTE project comprises a pipeline- built by ExxonMobil- along with a Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) facility and power plant, being constructed by the Government of Guyana (GoG), with funding from the United States Export Import (US EXIM) Bank.\n\nAccording to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) conducted by Exxon for the pipeline, gas will be transported to the Wales Development Site, West Bank Demerara from the Liza One and Liza Two projects in the Stabroek Block.\n\nWith the reserves of these two projects likely to be depleted soon, VP Jagdeo had indicated plans to utilize gas from others projects to support the project. This will further drive up the cost of the project.\n\nNorton was asked how Guyanese could determine the feasibility of the project for themselves, since the final cost is still unknown, when he said the Vice President should explain.\n\n“That is a question for the Vice President. In the Budget the last time, I did point out to the Prime Minister we don’t know the cost of it, we don’t know at what price the electricity will be sold…any proper economist would ensure those things happen. In fact, he (Jagdeo) criticized APNU for having feasibility studies,” the Opposition Leader noted.\n\nMeanwhile, on the loan contracted to finance the two gas plants, Norton pointed to the need for Guyana to be careful in how it increases its debt burden.\n\n“I have always argued, that we have to be sensible in how we (are) taking loans that we should use some of our oil resources and only if the loan is of real low interest, we should seek to take it, or the project is of absolute necessity. In this case therefore I would say that the government didn’t even do a feasibility study, so one doesn’t even know if this project, how successful it will be,” he argued.\n\nNorton said that while the outcome of the project is still uncertain, it is the hope of the Opposition that it does not turn out as detrimental as the Skeldon Sugar Factory where, similarly, there was no feasibility study that ended in a waste of resources.\n\nThe VP at his Thursday press conference defended the GTE project, arguing that the US EXIM Bank has confirmed the feasibility of the initiative through an independent study. He has already been challenged by the former Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Dr. Vincent Adams to publish copies of those studies.\n\nLoan Policy\n\nFurthermore, the Leader said he believes there is need for the development of a loan policy. He explained, “I believe as a government, you have to develop a loan policy; a policy that says the conditions under which you will take loans, what monies you will invest from oil into which areas, and that will only come if you have a plan, but this government doesn’t plan.”\n\nTo this end he committed to the development of such a policy.\n\n(Jagdeo must explain how Gas-to-Energy project is feasible with final cost still unknown- Norton)', 'en', NULL, '2025-01-05 00:00:00', 3, 'Forte pertinence (impact probable sur les prix)', 68.37, 1, 'energy', '2026-01-13 19:51:15', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Jagdeo must explain how Gas-to-Energy project is feasible with final cost still unknown- Norton//// https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2025/01/05/jagdeo-must-explain-how-gas-to-energy-project-is-feasible-with-final-cost-still-unknown-norton/');

Circuit considered under Chevron, we no longer afford deference to the FCC\'s reading of the statute,\" the decision said.\n\nBarry Gilbert, an investment strategist at Carson Group, said in a note on Friday that the Chevron doctrine was initially supported by conservative justices in 1984 \"because it made deregulation easier.\"\n\n\"Overturning Chevron was great (from a Republican perspective) when Democrats are in power, but it also makes deregulation more difficult, which is why the original Chevron case went to the Supreme Court in the first place,\" Gilbert said.\n\nWith Republicans set to hold a trifecta of power in the White House and both chambers of Congress later this month, the overturning of the Chevron doctrine could come back to bite them when it comes to enacting policies aimed at loosening regulations for the private sector, Gilbert said.\n\n\"Some efforts to lighten regulatory requirements are likely to be met with waves of litigation that may take years to work their way through the court system,\" Gilbert said.\n\nWhat could have been swift deregulation policies enacted by President-elect Trump could now take much longer to play out as lawsuits inevitably make their way before the courts.\n\n\"We are worse off than the Reagan administration was before the Chevron ruling, because courts will be drawn into the messy process of delineating exactly what the new ruling means,\" Gilbert said.\n\nIn a December note, UBS said that after the overturning of the Chevron doctrine, certain efforts to cut spending could also be impeded.\n\n\"The ruling also makes it harder to cut spending in areas that are well-defined in legislation,\" UBS said.\n\nUBS said that could impact the efforts of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, which seeks to significantly shrink the footprint of federal agencies.

For decades, this arrangement allowed Ukraine to collect transit fees, but it also left the country vulnerable to Moscow’s political games.\n\nIn 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, energy became both a weapon and a battlefield. Kyiv had to make a choice: continue to help Russia bankroll its war machine or take a hammer to the gas valve. Ukraine chose the latter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Ukraine Cut the Flow\n\nBy May 2022, Ukraine had already been suffering under the weight of war for months. Russian missiles had reduced cities to rubble, but Moscow continued to rake in billions from European energy sales, financing its invasion. That’s when Ukraine made its move, shutting down a key transit point for Russian natural gas in the Luhansk region, an area partially under Russian occupation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyiv cited “force majeure,” a legal term essentially meaning the situation made it impossible to continue operations. The official line was that Russia had been siphoning gas meant for Europe, but let’s not mince words—this was as much about strategy as it was about logistics. Ukraine knew that blocking the gas flow would force Europe to confront its dependence on Russian energy and accelerate efforts to find alternatives.\n\nThe Immediate Impact on Europe\n\nThe shutdown wasn’t without pain for Europe. Germany, Hungary, Austria, and others were left scrambling to secure alternative energy sources. Russia, in turn, played its own card, reducing gas flows through the Nord Stream pipeline under the pretext of “maintenance issues.”\n\nThis tit-for-tat left Europe teetering on the edge of an energy crisis. Natural gas prices skyrocketed, households struggled to pay heating bills, and governments faced mounting pressure to act. By winter, the energy shortage had become a top-tier political issue, leading countries to dust off coal plants, rush to secure liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments, and even consider rationing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLong-Term Ramifications for Russia\n\nRussia’s natural gas revenue took a hit, and its influence over Europe waned. For years, Moscow used energy as a geopolitical lever—threatening to cut supplies to nations that dared to oppose its policies. With Ukraine cutting the transit lines and Europe diversifying its energy sources, Russia’s hand weakened significantly.\n\nThe Kremlin’s pivot to selling gas to China and India isn’t enough to replace its lucrative European market. Building new pipelines takes years, and those markets don’t pay the premium prices Europe once did. Meanwhile, Western sanctions on Russian energy exports continue to bite.', 'en', 'Guy D.

Resolution 2334, which basically, to put it a little bit crudely, recognized the Green Line that is the June 5, 1967, ceasefire lines that separated Israel from Jordan as an international boundary,” Michael Doran, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of its center for peace and security in the Middle East, said on his podcast on Dec. 31.\n\nSpeaking with his co-host Gadi Taub, an Israeli historian and writer, Doran said that the Obama administration’s surprise meant that “any development that Israel has made to the east of the Green Line since the 1967 War is recognized by the U.N. as an illegal settlement,” reported the Jewish News Syndicate.\n\n“This means including the Western Wall uh is ‘occupied territory,\'” the former senior director in the U.S. National Security Council said on the “Israel Update” podcast.\n\n“Lots of neighborhoods that any Israeli today regards as Israel proper are regarded by 2334 as Israeli illegal Israeli settlements,” Doran said.\n\nHezbollah chief threatens to re-start hostilities if ceasefire conditions not upheld\n\nJUST IN Naim Qassem, Hezbollahs Secretary General warns in his speech: “Our patience might expire before the 60-day ceasefire ends.

The resistance is powerful, deterrent and effective, disrupting the enemy’s objectives despite the extensive destruction and Israeli aggression,” he added.\n\nRegarding the fragile cease-fire, Qassem said, “The resistance wielded significant power during the cease-fire. Israel was forced to request a cease-fire due to the resistance’s capabilities. We faced unprecedented aggression, stood firm and broke Israel’s strength. Sacrifice is the path to dignity and the resistance will continue.”\n\nBipartisan approach to U.S. airlines resuming flights to Israel\n\nFor all but two brief periods in 2024, the major U.S. carriers – Delta, United and American – have not flown to Tel Aviv since the war broke out, citing security concerns.\n\nEl Al, now passengers’ only option for direct flights to and from America, doesn’t have enough planes to meet travelers’ demand, leading to crushingly high prices and flights that are often sold out weeks or months in advance, reported Jewish Insider.\n\nSome European airlines have recently resumed flights to Israel after Israel reached a cease-fire deal with Lebanon, while several Gulf airlines have been flying to Israel throughout the conflict, including the United Arab Emirates-based Etihad Airways, which is now operating three daily flights to Tel Aviv. But those realities have not swayed U.S. airline executives.\n\nAt a meeting of United’s board of directors in early December, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said he has “no interest in returning to Tel Aviv only to pull out for a third time,” according to a source with knowledge of the conversation. United has also not resumed service to Amman, where it flew during the first several months of the war but suspended service in August.\n\nPennsylvania man indicted on terrorism charges for joining Hezbollah\n\nJack Danaher Molloy, a 24-year-old former US Army soldier from Pittsburgh, has been indicted for attempting to join Hezbollah in Lebanon & Syria.

And why aren’t Americans adequately educated to identify potential terrorists themselves? Most urgently, what more can police do to detect and prevent explosive devices from being planted in our streets?\n\nUnfortunately, lax laws dating back decades have enabled terrorists to use the United States as a base, and the internet as their tool for recruitment.\n\nThe 1996 Communications Decency Act, for instance, was designed to incentivize big-tech to remove content deemed harmful to children.\n\nBut Section 230 of the Act shields tech platforms from liability for harmful content posted by users, including extremist and terrorist material.\n\nTerrorism-related content can proliferate without consequence, facilitating real-world violence.\n\nDespite enhanced surveillance resources under the controversial 2001 USA Patriot Act, Federal law efforts failed on Bourbon Street.

It’s for society and the state to address the issue, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.\n\nThe testimonies of the victims are hard to read. Girls being forced into barbaric sexual acts. Raped by multiple men at the same time or one after the other.

And now the sea continues to wash them up,” the center wrote, noting that most of the dead dolphins were from the endangered Azov species.\n\nRussia’s Emergencies Ministry said Sunday that over 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil had been removed by officials and volunteers along the shoreline of the Krasnodar region’s Anapa and Temryuk districts.\n\nRussia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency on Saturday after oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula’s largest city some 250 kilometres (155 miles) from the Kerch Strait.\n\nOn Dec. 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an “ecological disaster.”\n\nThe Kerch Strait is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.\n\nIt has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.\n\nMykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office, described the oil spill last month as a “large-scale environmental disaster” and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.\n\nPostmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

Over the last few years, FSIS has pushed for more accountability from industry to produce safe and wholesome products. Through numerous calls, meetings, roundtables and guidance documents, we are proactively engaging with industry on ways to reduce products that must be recalled and we are seeing the results of these efforts,” Jackson Collier, a USDA FSIS public affairs specialist, told Food Poisoning Bulletin.\n\n“Industry is acting faster on potential situations that may result in adulteration of products, in some instances using electronic means to control and hold products in their distribution chain to prevent them from reaching the consumers. FSIS reviews the actions of the firms and assesses each situation on a case-by-case basis. If FSIS finds that the products are not under control and they are available for sale, then the agency requests the firm to recall the product,” he said.\n\nRecalls Linked to Pathogens\n\nNine recalls were issued for bacterial contamination. Of these, six were for Listeria, two were for E. coli, and one was for Salmonella. In four of these cases, the problem was discovered by a state agency, four more were through routine testing by USDA FSIS, and one was tied to a company’s tests.\n\nFour recalls were linked to food poisoning outbreaks.\n\nPublic Health Alerts\n\nUSDA FSIS issues Public Health Alerts (PHAs) to notify the public about a problem with a meat or poultry product when it has decided not to request a recall from a company. Most often, this happens when the product is no longer for sale and, unfortunately, consumers have likely eaten the tainted food.\n\nAlthough PHAs have the same information as recalls, they don’t carry the same weight. Consumers aren’t as likely to hear about them because companies aren’t required to contact customers, retailers generally don’t post them in stores or on their websites, and the media doesn’t pay much attention to them.\n\nIn recent years, PHAs have become more common. Before the pandemic, the 10-year annual average for these notifications was about four, now it’s 20. In 2024, USDA FSIS issued 19 PHAs, five fewer than in 2023.\n\nReasons for Recalls\n\nMisbranding and undeclared allergens continued to be the top reason for a recall in 2024, followed by bacterial contamination, lack of inspection, foreign matter, import violation, and ingredients or processes that render food unfit for human consumption.\n\nRecalls Linked to Outbreaks\n\nFour recalls were linked to outbreaks in 2024.\n\nYu Shang Listeria Outbreak\n\nA deadly Listeria outbreak linked to Yu Shang brand ready-to-eat products sickened 19 people in eight states. Seventeen people were hospitalized and two families suffered the loss of their infants.\n\nWolverine Ground Beef/Red Cow E. coli Outbreak\n\nAn E. coli outbreak linked to ground beef produced by Wolverine Packing Company of Detroit sickened at least 15 people. The tainted ground beef was served at Hen House and Red Cow locations in Minnesota and restaurants in Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, and Missouri.\n\nFratelli Beretta\n\nA Salmonella outbreak linked to Busseto brand charcuterie platters sold at Sam’s Club, Costco, and other stores sickened 104 people, 27 of whom were hospitalized. On February 13, Fratelli Beretta of Mount Olive, NJ recalled all of its products containing coppa.\n\nThis is not the first time Fratelli Beretta’s charcuterie has been linked to an outbreak. In 2021, the company recalled 431 tons of uncured antipasto trays containing prosciutto, soppressata, Milano salami, and coppa after they were linked to a 17-state Salmonella outbreak.\n\nBoar’s Head\n\nA 19-state Listeria outbreak linked to Boar’s Head liverwurst and other deli-sliced meat ended after sickening 61 people killing 10 of them.\n\nThe filthy conditions at the company’s plant in Jarratt, VA triggered a law enforcement probe and outrage from members of Congress including Representative Rosa DeLauro (D-CT) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) who urged USDA Secretary Thomas Vilsack and Attorney General Merrick Garland to explore possible criminal charges for Boar’s Head officials.\n\nOn July 26, Boar’s Head recalled some deli meats sold at grocery stores nationwide after a link to the outbreak was established. One week later, the company issued a 7-million-pound recall expansion that included all of the meat produced at the Jarratt facility which has since been permanently closed.\n\nBoar’s Head Horror Prompts USDA to Review Its Inspection Model\n\nInspectors Found Insects, Mold, Pools of Blood\n\nInspectors working on behalf of USDA FSIS found dozens of food safety violations at the Boar’s Head plant in Jarratt months before the outbreak occurred, according to documents obtained by CBS News through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.\n\nCBS obtained one year of monthly inspection reports from August 1, 2023, to August 2, 2024. During that period, inspectors visited the plant 58 times and found at least one violation each time yet no enforcement actions were taken.\n\nThe violations included: animal blood pooling on the floor, meat so old it had turned gray that was caked onto machinery, foul odors in cooler and other areas of the facility, dead and live insects, water dripping from the ceiling, standing pools of water some with algae, a black mold-like substance on the walls, rusty equipment, and doors, walls, and ceilings in a state of disrepair.\n\nIn the months since these reports were made public, no explanation has been offered as to why violations weren’t issued. The inspectors were from the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) tapped to provide federal inspections for USDA FSIS under the Talmadge-Aiken Cooperative Inspection Program.\n\nVirginia is one of 29 states that conducts meat and poultry inspections on behalf of USDA FSIS. Other states operating under this agreement are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nAfter the regulatory failure in Jarratt, USDA FSIS said it is reviewing the inspection model to prevent future oversight gaps.\n\n“Ten people died in this outbreak,” said noted Food Safety Attorney and Food Poisoning Bulletin Publisher Eric Hageman. “Any improvement to the inspection system that can make the food we eat safer is welcome and overdue.”', 'en', 'Carla Gillespie, News Desk, Linda Larsen', '2025-01-03 23:35:02', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 67.49, 1, 'total', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', '2024 Meat and Poultry Recalls Plummet from 2023 Total//// https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2025/2024-meat-and-poultry-recalls-plummet-from-2023-total/'),

Among the record-setting 80% renewable energy usage in 2024, the electric usage is roughly split in thirds: Between residential, commercial, and the seafood processing industry.\n\nThis winter, for the first time, CEC also introduced a winter incentive rate. For members reaching a certain usage rate, their rates will drop way down.\n\nCordova, at the head of Orca Inlet on the east side of Prince William Sound, lies off the state’s road system. The average total cost of housing, food, childcare, transportation, healthcare, taxes and other necessities for a single adult come to about $44,914 annually – compared to $45,372 statewide and $38,433 nationally.\n\nWith the impact of global warming on the environment, Cordova, like many other communities, is focused on replacing traditional energy sources like diesel fuel with renewable energy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the last 20 years, CEC has employed energy efficiency and conservation projects to further reduce Cordova’s use of costly diesel fuel – which is barged into town – and its associated environmental impact. These projects have included member education, purchase and distribution of energy saving devices, community-wide conversion to LED street lighting, and more.\n\nThe hydro power comes from the Humpback Creek hydroelectric plant seven miles north of Cordova – which has with a total installed generating capacity of 1.25 megawatts – and the Power Creek hydroelectric plant seven miles east of Cordova – with installed generating capacity of 6.0 megawatts. The Orca Power Plant, on the outskirts of Cordova, is the cooperative’s only diesel generation facility. It has installed generating capacity of 10.8 megawatts.\n\nEvery single home in Cordova currently uses diesel fuel in their hot water heaters, but CEC is promoting a variety of heat pumps to replace those hot water and other heaters.\n\nHowever, Stavig acknowledged that installers are hard to get a hold of to do the work involved.\n\n“The technology is new and it is hard to get contractors to do this,” he said.\n\nRight now there is only one contractor in Cordova who does this, and other contractors are busy working on hot water heaters using diesel fuel.\n\nCEC is offering $5,000 toward the transition from diesel hot water heaters to the heat pumps, which are very popular in Southeast Alaska communities like Juneau and Ketchikan, but so far haven’t had many takers.\n\nStavig himself said he has been using a heat pump in his home and saved a little money even before CEC began offering the $5,000 incentive in October. Diesel is at a fairly cheap price right now compared to what it was a couple of years ago, but there are still a lot of incentives to switch to heat pumps, he said. That’s true especially if Cordova has a warm winter, since users get more out of hydroelectric power in a mild winter.\n\nThe cooperative has put everything in place for a transition to heat pumps and it’s now up to individual people to decide what they want to do, Stavig said.\n\n“Overall, people are really positive about renewable energy and diesel is seven times more expensive than hydroelectric,” he said. “Everyone’s utility bill has a little note on it saying now much is saved by hydro.”\n\nCEC has a total of 15 employees, all members of the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers.\n\n“We are a pretty respected employer and are able to hire some good crews,” Stavig said. “We have been happy with what we have been able to get … The overall result of 80% use of hydroelectric power was due to the hard work of CEC employees, who also worked to make diesel generators more efficient.”\n\nStavig went on to praise CEC’s green energy goals.\n\n“I think just hitting that 80% renewable is huge for us,” he said. “Cordova Electric is killing it. We are proud of that accomplishment and hoping to do every better in the future.”', 'en', 'Margaret Bauman Is A Veteran Alaska Journalist Focused On Covering Fisheries, Environmental Issues.

It was the first time the court addressed the issue.\n\nIn the case, an employee for the department of transportation injured his back in 1994 while lifting a 300- to 400-pound tractor-trailer tire over a barrier on Interstate 84. He underwent surgeries and pain management. He received workers’ compensation benefits.\n\nIn 2003, he accepted an early retirement package. He was 54 years old and had no intention of returning to the workforce.\n\nWhile he left his job, he did not, unfortunately, leave behind his back condition. It continued to plague him and deteriorate. The condition became so severe that, in 2015, he sought total incapacity benefits. Ultimately, an appeals court denied benefits, and the employee appealed.\n\nSection 31-307(a) provides in relevant part: \"If any injury for which compensation is provided … results in total incapacity to work, the injured employee shall be paid a weekly compensation equal to seventy-five per cent of the injured employee\'s average weekly earnings as of the date of the injury.”\n\nThe employer argued that because the total incapacity occurred after the employee retired, and because he had no intention of returning to work, the provision did not apply.\n\nWas retirement a roadblock to the transportation workers’ total incapacity benefits?\n\nA. Yes. His total incapacity was the result of the back injury he sustained lifting the tires.\n\nB. No. Because the purpose of the statute is to replace wages, an employee\'s injury cannot result in total incapacity to work if he retires and willingly chooses not to work.\n\nIf you selected A, you agreed with the court in Cochran v. Department of Transp., No. SC 20940 (Conn. 12/24/24), which held that total incapacity benefits are available even to employees whose total incapacity occurs post-retirement.\n\nThe court rejected the employer’s argument that the employee was not entitled to total incapacity benefits because the incapacity occurred after he left the workforce. It pointed out that there is nothing in the statute to suggest such a limitation, and that the legislature could easily have said so if it meant to place such a limitation in the law. The statute, instead, requires that the workplace injury result in total incapacity for benefits to be available.\n\nFurther, the court’s decision did not collide with the purposes of the statute, the court stated. It acknowledged the employer’s argument that there were no wages to replace given that the employee was retired. The court, however, noted that wage replacement is not the only purpose of the statute. Another purpose is to compensate an employee for lack of earning capacity.\n\nSimply Research subscribers have access to the full text of the decision.', 'en', NULL, '2025-01-04 01:10:26', 3, 'Forte pertinence (impact probable sur les prix).', 66.5, 1, 'total', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Was Post-Retirement Total Incapacity Compensable in Connecticut?//// https://www.workerscompensation.com/daily-headlines/was-post-retirement-total-incapacity-compensable-in-connecticut/'),

Enter Email Sign Up\n\nBiden’s orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico, where most US offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future drilling.\n\nFEATURED VIDEO\n\nBiden’s actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind, since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. The 72-year-old law that Biden cited allows the president to withdraw portions of the outer continental shelf from mineral leasing, including leasing to drill for oil and gas, if the areas are deemed too sensitive to drill.\n\nTrump himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina until 2032.\n\nEarlier in his term, Trump had initially moved to vastly expand offshore drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and other coastal states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump on Monday declared that, after he’s inaugurated on Jan. 20, Biden’s drilling ban will “be changed on day one.”\n\n“I will unban it immediately” Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt. “I have the right to unban it.”\n\nHe said the US has “oil and gas at a level that nobody else has and we’re gonna take advantage of it. It’s really our greatest economic asset.”\n\nTrump has vowed to establish what he calls American “energy dominance” around the world as he seeks to boost US oil and gas drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change.\n\nEnvironmental advocates hailed Biden’s action, saying new oil and gas drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest in recorded history.\n\n“This is an epic ocean victory!” said Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana.\n\nGordon thanked Biden “for listening to the voices from coastal communities” that oppose drilling and “contributing to the bipartisan tradition of protecting our coasts.”\n\nBiden’s actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said, adding that US coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries.\n\nIn balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show “relatively minimal potential” that does not justify possible environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling.\n\nThe National Ocean Industries Association, which represents offshore drillers, called Biden’s decision “a strategic error, driven not by science or voter mandate, but by political motives.’’\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This move directly undermines American energy consumers and jeopardizes the vast benefits tied to a thriving domestic energy sector,” said Erik Milito, the group’s president.\n\nEven if there’s no immediate interest in drilling in some offshore areas, “it’s crucial for the federal government to maintain the flexibility to adapt” to unexpected global events such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he said. “Blanket bans only serve to transfer energy production and economic opportunities abroad, inadvertently bolstering countries like Russia at the expense of US interests.”\n\nBiden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight against climate change.\n\nA five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to continue expanding offshore wind development.\n\nUnder the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind leases.\n\nBiden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.\n\nSandra Bundy, president of the Florida-based Business Alliance for Protecting the Atlantic Coast, said she was “thrilled and thankful” for Biden’s actions, which she said will protect the Eastern seaboard for generations to come.\n\n“Opening all federal waters to offshore exploration and drilling posed serious threats to coastal economies and ecosystems that are critical to millions along the coast,” Bundy said. “Cities and towns large and small oppose the industrialization of the Atlantic and are increasingly seeing stronger storms and flooding and face serious threats from rising sea levels. Those threats would increase in magnitude if offshore drilling was added to the mix.”', 'en', NULL, '2025-01-04 00:00:00', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 65.5, 1, 'drilling,oil', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Biden bans offshore oil, gas drilling in most federal waters//// https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/04/business/biden-oil-drilling-ban/'),

They said reducing emissions by moving to renewable energy would halt global heating and deliver more reliable energy.\n\nThirteen of the ports with the highest supertanker traffic will be seriously damaged by just 1 metre of sea level rise, the analysis found. The researchers said two low-lying ports in Saudi Arabia – Ras Tanura and Yanbu – were particularly vulnerable. Both are operated by Aramco, the Saudi state oil firm, and 98% of the country’s oil exports leave via these ports.\n\nThe oil ports of Houston and Galveston in the US, the world’s biggest oil producer, are also on the list, as are ports in the United Arab Emirates, China, Singapore and the Netherlands.\n\nThe latest science published by the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI) shows 1 metre of sea level rise is now inevitable within a century or so and could come as early as 2070 if ice sheets collapse and emissions are not curbed. An even more catastrophic rise of 3 metres is probably inevitable in the next millennium or two and could arrive as soon as the early 2100s.\n\nSea level rise is already causing problems around the world even before it overtops coastline developments. The rise to date means storm surges are higher and significantly more likely to cause coastal flooding, while infiltration of saltwater into coastal land can corrode foundations, the researchers note. Cutting emissions sharply would not only slow the rate of sea level rise but also limit the ultimate rise.\n\nPam Pearson, the ICCI director, said: “It’s ironic these oil tanker ports are below 1 metre of sea level rise and need to have their eyes on these potentially higher rates of sea level rise, which themselves come from continued fossil fuel use.”\n\nSea level rise is the most profound long-term impact of the climate crisis, redrawing the map of the world and affecting many major cities from New York to Shanghai. But Pearson said government and corporate short-term interests meant it was being overlooked. “Basic information [from scientific assessments of sea level rise] don’t seem to have gotten into the consciousness of governments,” she said.\n\nJames Kirkham, the chief science adviser at ICCI, said: “Refusing to turn off the oil taps means keeping the taps on for sea level rise. Accelerated ice melt and ocean expansion has already caused the rate of sea level rise to double in the last 30 years. Unless leaders double down on transitioning away from fossil fuels, the terrible impacts of sea level rise will only increase further – affecting every country with a coastline, including those who continue to obstruct increased decarbonisation efforts.”\n\nAramco declined to comment.\n\nSaudi Arabia has been accused of obstructionism at a series of recent global summits, including “wrecking ball” tactics at the Cop29 climate assembly, and of blocking progress at negotiations on a plastics treaty and on tackling drought and desertification. The latter talks were held in Riyadh and ended without agreement, with the Saudis refusing to include any reference to climate in the agreement.\n\nThe new analysis built on work from May by China Water Risk in which researchers found that 12 of the 15 oil ports with the biggest oil tanker traffic were vulnerable to sea level rise. Zero Carbon Analytics used maps of sea level rise from Climate Central and GoogleMaps to show that a 1-metre rise would damage jetties, oil storage facilities, refineries and other infrastructure.\n\nThe new analysis added the second Saudi port, Yanbu, which is also at high risk with a 1-metre rise. The team used Bloomberg oil export data to estimate the volume and value of the oil being imported and exported from the ports. Together, Ras Tanura and Yanbu exported $214bn (£171bn) worth of oil in 2023. In total, the 13 ports accounted for about 20% of global oil exports in 2023.\n\nMurray Worthy, of Zero Carbon Analytics, who is part of the team, said: “This analysis shows that relying on fossil fuels in a warming world is a path to disaster, not energy security. Countries face a choice: stick with fossil fuels and risk supply disruptions as rising seas flood ports and terminals, or transition to secure, sustainable domestic renewables.”\n\nEfforts could be made to build flood defences, which would be very costly, but Worthy said: “Ultimately it’s a losing battle.

Gas can still travel from Russia to Europe via the Turkstream pipeline, but no longer through Ukraine, cutting gas imports to the EU by around 14 billion cubic metres.\n\nThe European Commission has said that this volume can be replaced by liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline imports from other sources, such as Norway and the United States.\n\nHowever, the impact is already being felt in parts of EU candidate country Moldova, which was getting Russian gas via Ukraine.\n\nThe breakaway Russian-speaking region of Transnistria, home to around 45,000 people, cut supplies to households. “There is no heating or hot water,” said a worker at energy company Tirasteploenergo.\n\nThe financial impact\n\nThough Ukraine benefitted financially from the now-expired agreement to the tune of $800m (£640m) a year, the gas was not imported to Ukraine itself.\n\nLatest estimates show that Russia is expected to lose around €5bn (£4.14bn) a year from gas transported to Europe via Ukraine.\n\nAccording to its own reports, Gazprom’s market capitalisation stands at around £22bn (3 trillion roubles).\n\nGazprom is Russia’s largest company, and has the largest gas reserves in the world. Since the invasion of Ukraine its business has taken several blows.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Russian gas exported to Europe via the Ukraine pipelines alone has already dropped by 78 per cent since the contract started in 2020.\n\nAnd for the first time since 2001, Gazprom reported a net loss of £5.5bn (629 billion roubles) in 2023, after gas sales plummeted.\n\nUp to this point, the gas giant consistently raked in billions each year; including even £14bn (1.9 trillion roubles) in 2022, during the first year of the war.\n\nRevenue decreased by around 27 per cent in 2023, to £61bn, while revenue from gas sales in particular fell by 40 per cent.\n\nIn this context, a loss of £4.14bn in gas sales without the Ukraine transit deal could trigger a further 6.7 per cent decrease in revenues for Gazprom and Russia.\n\nThe Russian oil and gas war chest\n\nopen image in gallery Russia’s oil industry is seen as vital to financing its continued war against Ukraine ( AP )\n\nGazprom is majority state-owned, which means that the Russian state receives a sizeable sum of its profits.\n\nRussia relies on oil and gas business in part to fund its ongoing war in Ukraine; with revenues accounting for 30 to 50 per cent of the Russian federal budget, according to The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES). Other than the EU, Russia’s biggest pipeline gas exports go to Turkey and Belarus, while LNG exports are largely reliant on sales to China and Japan.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Russian gas exports to China are discounted as heavily as -28 per cent compared to European exports, meaning that they are less profitable for Russia overall. But ultimately, the vast majority of Russian state oil and gas revenues come from oil sales, rather than gas sales, according to the OIES.\n\nAlthough the EU has banned oil imports from Russia, numerous reports suggest that Russian oil is still reaching the EU via back channels.\n\nA Global Witness investigation found that 130 million barrels of refined products were imported into the EU from refineries that process Russian crude oil in 2023, worth an estimated €1.1bn in tax revenue to the Kremlin.\n\nRussia is the largest crude oil supplier to China and India. The UK and EU countries import billions in refined oil from these two countries, part of which is likely originating from Russia despite sanctions.\n\nThe trouble with Russian gas\n\nopen image in gallery Russian president Vladimir Putin (L) and Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh shake hands ( EPA )\n\nSeparately to sanctions from the invasion of Ukraine, European countries’ reliance on Russian gas has been a difficult challenge to address.\n\nRussia has historically used its gas pipeline exports to exert political control over dependent countries, from Ukraine to Armenia.\n\nAs of today, Gazprom is also weaponising the same tactic in Moldova, cutting off gas supplies over an alleged $709m (£565m) debt.\n\nYet the decision not to extend gas transit via Ukraine faced some pushback.\n\nSlovakia’s prime minister threatened to cut electricity supplies to Ukraine in retaliation, as he said that ending Russian gas transit would increase energy prices.\n\nNonetheless, gas transit via Ukraine’s pipelines has now ceased.', 'en', NULL, '2025-01-04 08:33:20', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 65.41, 1, 'gazprom,pipeline', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Ukraine ends Russian gas pipeline to Europe – but how much will it cost Moscow?//// https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-gas-pipeline-ukraine-gazprom-b2673631.html'),

Soneye explained that NNPCL’s efforts at the Port Harcourt Refinery went beyond routine maintenance, involving a complete overhaul to meet international standards. He noted similar rehabilitation projects underway at the Warri, old Port Harcourt, and Kaduna refineries. According to Soneye, NNPCL’s transition from a government corporation to a private entity with limited liability has shifted its focus to profitability, positioning it as a competitive global energy company. In response to the invitation, Obasanjo, speaking through his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, in an interview with Punch, described it as a total disrespect to his person and office.\n\nObasanjo said the oil company had not sent any formal invitation to him as of Thursday, January 2, 2024.\n\nHe said, “Is that the right way to invite a former president of the country?

Consequently, he said, “So don’t come…he’s coming with this foolishness that EXIM did an EIA and we said they never did an EIA.”\n\nKaieteur News understands that the EIA process not only involves the review of impacts from a project but also critically involves Guyanese to allow for comments, feedback and questions at almost each stage. An EIA is usually conducted following a decision by the EPA. The public is usually then engaged to inform the consultant of issues that should be addressed in the study. Upon completion of the study, it is published for public comments again.\n\nDr. Adams also pointed out that the EIA conducted by ExxonMobil for the gas pipeline clearly stated that a separate environmental study would be done for gas plants. He recalled that government said there would be no EIA for the project but is now claiming that the US EXIM Bank not only conducted an EIA but a feasibility study for the project.\n\n“What was interesting is that he is giving us all kinds of numbers, show us those numbers, you said you were gonna produce at 22 cents per kilowatt now you are producing at four cents, but you are selling at 22 cents.

(Tim Smith/The Brandon Sun)\n\nBrandon Mayor Jeff Fawcett explained during the end-of-the-year interview with Sun’s managing editor Matt Goerzen that energy constraints faced by industrial clients have been a longstanding issue in Brandon.\n\n“For homes, we’ve never had a hydro issue,” he pointed out. “It’s the large things. We’re a little tighter on capacity for some of the big projects — Saputo’s (Dairy Products) two megawatts. Behlen Industries is one megawatt. Maple Leaf is 17 megawatts. We’d have a tough time bringing in another Maple Leaf, but the upgrade will allow us to support large industries like Chemtrade, which uses 225 megawatts.”\n\nFawcett also emphasized the importance of planning, noting that efforts to secure additional industrial land are already underway. “You don’t wait for 2027 to start preparing,” Fawcett stated, adding that collaboration with Manitoba Hydro and private developers has been key in laying the groundwork for growth.\n\nIn November 2023, the governments of Canada and Manitoba announced an investment of nearly $500 million to enhance Manitoba’s clean electricity grid. This includes $314 million for eight new turbines at the Pointe du Bois Generating Station, adding 52 megawatts of capacity for eastern Manitoba, and $161.6 million for a new transmission network in Portage la Prairie.\n\nThese projects will also help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase reliability and meet growing demand while maintaining Manitoba’s reputation for having some of Canada’s most affordable electricity rates.\n\nManitoba Hydro corporate communications director Scott Powell told the Sun the corporation has made “significant strides” toward installing the upgrade.\n\n“Manitoba Hydro placed the Wash’ake Mayzoon Station in Portage la Prairie into service as part of the Portage Area Capacity Enhancement Project in 2023,” Powell told the Sun. “This project, which will eventually provide additional transmission capacity into the Brandon area, includes not just the new station, but also a new 230,000-volt transmission line from Manitoba Hydro’s Dorsey Converter Station northwest of Winnipeg to Wash’ake Mayzoon, and some other upgrades to equipment at sub-stations in the area.”\n\nWhile some planning and construction work remains, including the completion of the Dorsey transmission line, Powell affirmed that Manitoba Hydro is on track to meet the deadline.\n\n“Completion of the transmission line and associated work, currently estimated for 2027, will enhance transmission capacity into the Brandon area, allowing for population growth and economic development,” he added.\n\nPowell explained new industrial and commercial customers would apply for service through its normal service extension process, as the organization work closely with cities, towns and municipalities across the province to support economic development.\n\nFawcett added that the upgrade aligns with Brandon’s broader economic goals, including the development of industrial land and the establishment of a strong partnership with Manitoba Hydro. “The minister has been forthright and supportive, and Hydro has kept us well-informed throughout the process.”\n\nBrandon Mayor Jeff Fawcett says the city is a little tighter on capacity for some of the big projects. “Saputo’s (Dairy Products) two megawatts. Behlen Industries is one megawatt. Maple Leaf is 17 megawatts. We’d have a tough time bringing in another Maple Leaf, but the upgrade will allow us to support large industries like Chemtrade, which uses 225 megawatts,” he said. (File)\n\nPowell assured residents that residential service will remain unaffected during construction.\n\n“There is electrical capacity in place to ensure reliable service while the transmission upgrades are completed,” he said. “The upgrades are part of our plan to ensure future growth in the area can be accommodated.”\n\nFinance Minister Adrien Sala, who is responsible for Manitoba Hydro, told the Sun the government is proud to have made the $90.6 million in investments that will ensure Brandon and the surrounding region can continue to grow their economy and prosper for years to come.\n\n“Manitoba Hydro is one of the most important assets our province has when it comes to being a leader in the low-carbon economy,” Sala said on Friday. “Through our Affordable Energy Plan, our government will continue to invest in Manitoba Hydro by refurbishing generating stations and unlocking 200 megawatts of power, as well as creating an Indigenous Loan Guarantee program to bring 600 megawatts of wind power online.”\n\nThe minister explained the investments would mean more low-carbon jobs, more progress toward achieving the province’s net-zero targets and more opportunities to lower (utility) costs for working families.\n\n» aodutola@brandonsun.com\n\n» X: @AbiolaOdutola', 'en', 'Abiola Odutola', '2025-01-04 00:00:00', 3, 'Forte pertinence (choc majeur ou immédiat sur les prix)', 63.4, 1, 'energy', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'Brandon on track for 100 MW energy boost – Brandon Sun//// https://www.brandonsun.com/business/2025/01/04/brandon-on-track-for-100-mw-energy-boost'),

The media briefing will begin at 1:00 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), and you\'ll be able to listen in online via NASA\'s website.\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Nicky Fox, the agency\'s associate administrator for science missions, will host the Mars exploration briefing. \"The briefing will include NASA\'s efforts to complete its goals of returning scientifically selected samples from Mars to Earth while lowering cost, risk and mission complexity,\" NASA officials wrote in a Jan. 3 statement.\n\nNASA\'s Mars Sample Return program is designed to do just what its name suggests: return pieces of Mars to Earth so scientists can study the Red Planet up close. To that end, NASA\'s Perseverance rover on Mars has already collected and cached a bevy of samples since it arrived on the planet in 2021.\n\n\"The agency\'s Mars Sample Return Program has been a major long-term goal of international planetary exploration for more than two decades,\" NASA wrote in the statement. \"NASA\'s Perseverance rover is collecting compelling science samples that will help scientists understand the geological history of Mars, the evolution of its climate, and prepare for future human explorers. The return of the samples also will help NASA\'s search for signs of ancient life.\"\n\nBut the mission to return those Perseverance Mars rover samples to Earth is at a crossroads.\n\nOne plan to return Perseverance\'s samples to Earth called for a lander to touch down near the rover, use a sophisticated robotic arm (or perhaps robotic drones like NASA\'s Ingenuity Mars helictoper) to collect the samples from Perserverance and store them in a rocket that would then launch into orbit. Another spacecraft, provided by the European Space Agency, would then collect the sample capsule for the trip to Earth.\n\nGet the Space.com Newsletter Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!

By April 2024, the mission\'s complexity and technical challenges were clearer, and its price tag rose to an estimated $11 billion at its high end. An assessment in September 2023 also found more bad news: Because of the complicated architecture of the plan, NASA would likely not be able to return Perseverance\'s samples to Earth until 2040, a full 20 years after the rover first launched to Mars.\n\nThis NASA image shows the many different parts of NASA and ESA\'s Mars Sample Return mission, including a lander, ascent vehicle, return spacecraft, drone and the Perseverance rover, of course. (Image credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech)\n\n\"The bottom line is that $11 billion is too expensive, and not returning samples until 2040 is unacceptably too long,\" Nelson said of that finding during an April 2024 media call.\n\nChina, for example, plans to launch its own sample return mission to Mars in 2028 with the goal of returning those samples to Earth in 2031. So, NASA isn\'t alone in its race to collect samples of Mars.\n\nThroughout 2024, NASA has worked to revamp its Mars sample return plan into a scenario that would reduce its cost and complexity. Tuesday\'s media briefing may reveal some of the new thinking that could go into that plan.\n\nLast month, Nelson told reporters at NASA\'s Kennedy Space Center that the new Mars sample return plan will include more than just NASA centers.\n\n\"What’s coming out is by involving industry, and not NASA centers like [the Jet Propulsion Laboratory], combining with others, they\'re coming out with much more practical (proposals), where they can speed up the time and considerably lower the cost,\" Spaceflight Now quoted Nelson as saying during the Dec. 18 meeting.', 'en', 'Tariq Malik, Social Links Navigation', '2025-01-04 13:00:00', 3, 'Pertinence modérée (impact possible mais limité)', 66.42, 1, 'exploration', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'NASA will announce update to Mars sample return plans today.

Before the deal, President Obasanjo had acquired large shares in Transcorp through ‘blind trust.\n\nMany interest groups in the country questioned the legal validity and moral propriety of the sales as they were consummated in the last days of the Obasanjo Administration,” Falana alleged, raising concerns about conflicts of interest.\n\nThe senior lawyer pointed out that under the Privatisation and Commercialisation Act, the Vice President serves as the chairman of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), which oversees the sale of public enterprises.\n\nHowever, Obasanjo reportedly sidelined then-Vice President Atiku Abubakar and directly managed the privatisation process for several key national assets.\n\nFalana said on May 17, 2007, President Obasanjo sold a 51%.\n\nFalana said on May 17, 2007, President Obasanjo sold a 51% stake in the Port Harcourt refinery to Bluestar Oil for US$561 million.\n\nHe explained that in another transaction that took place on May 28, 2007, President Obasanjo sold 51% shares in Kaduna Refinery to Bluestar Oil for $160 million.\n\nHe noted that the two powerful trade unions in the oil industry —the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) kicked against the privatisation of the two refineries on grounds of conflict of interest and lack of due process.\n\n“They also alleged that the nation had been shortchanged as the shares acquired in the Port Harcourt refinery for $516 million were worth US$5 billion.\n\n“Convinced that the deals were not in the national interest, both unions proceeded on a 4-day strike that almost paralysed the Nigerian economy in June 2007.

For this, it is using cluster munitions so as to cause maximum damage.\n\nA cluster munition is a form of air-dropped or ground-launched explosive weapon that releases or ejects smaller submunitions. Commonly, this is a cluster bomb that ejects explosive bomblets that are designed to kill personnel and destroy vehicles. Other cluster munitions are designed to destroy runways or electric power transmission lines.\n\nRussia has used such munitions extensively in Ukraine.\n\nHerman Halushchenko, Ukraine’s Minister of Energy shared this information during a national telethon on January 3, 2025 as he said that 2024 was particularly challenging for Ukraine’s energy network as Russian attacks have severely damaged Ukraine’s infrastructure.\n\nAdd India.com as a Preferred Source\n\nBetween March and December of 2024, Russian forces launched 13 large-scale assaults on energy facilities. According to Herman Halushchenko, there has been a shift in both the strategic approach and weaponry used by Russian forces, including the use of Kh-101 missiles. Kh-101 missiles deploy deadly sub munitions designed to damage critical infrastructure and complicate repair efforts.\n\nApart from Kh-101 missiles, Russia’s arsenal of cluster munitions includes RBK-500 air-dropped bombs with PTAB-1M sub munitions, 220mm “Uragan” and 300mm “Smerch” rockets carrying 9N210 and 9N235 sub munitions, and “Iskander-M” ballistic missiles equipped with 9N730 submunitions.\n\nThese cluster munitions scatter explosives over large areas, making them highly effective against dispersed or fortified targets.\n\nRussia has also used Tochka-U, or SS-21 Scarab-B weapons in Ukraine. This is a short-range ballistic missile launched from a mobile platform with a range of 120 km. It is equipped with a precision guidance system and can carry various warheads, including the 9N123K cluster munition, which is capable of dispersing explosives across a wide area. Its flexibility and ability to operate in diverse conditions make it a strategic tool for modern military operations.\n\nIn the face of these widespread attacks, Ukraine faces immense challenges as the winter and cold are at their peak and the demand for energy is also very high. The destruction of power infrastructure results in widespread outages, affecting daily life and disrupting essential services such as hospitals and schools.\n\nRussia’s purpose behind targeting Ukraine’s energy systems is to weaken its resistance and dishearten the population and unsettle military logistics.\n\nFor breaking news and live news updates, like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.

Sign up for Grist’s weekly newsletter here.\n\nIt takes approximately 700,000 megawatt hours of electricity to power Chicago’s more than 400 municipal buildings every year. As of January 1, every single one of them — including 98 fire stations, two international airports, and two of the largest water treatment plants on the planet — is running on renewable energy, thanks largely to Illinois’ newest and largest solar farm.\n\n\n\nThe move is projected to cut the carbon footprint of the country’s third-largest city by approximately 290,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year — the equivalent of taking 62,000 cars off the road, according to the city. Local decarbonization efforts like Chicago’s are taking on increasing significance as President-elect Donald Trump promises to reduce federal support for climate action. With the outgoing Biden administration doubling down on an international pledge to get the U.S. to net-zero emissions by 2050, cities, states, and private-sector players across the country will have to pick up the slack.\n\nChicago is one of several U.S. cities that are taking advantage of their bulk-buying power to spur new carbon-free energy development.\n\n“It’s a plan that gets the city to take action on climate and also leverages our buying power to generate new opportunities for Chicagoans and the state,” said Angela Tovar, Chicago’s chief sustainability officer. “There’s opportunities everywhere.”\n\nChicago’s switch to renewable energy has been almost a decade in the making. The goal of sourcing the city’s power purely from carbon-free sources was first established by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2017. His successor, Mayor Lori Lightfoot, struck a 2022 deal with Constellation, an electricity supplier, to purchase the city’s energy from the developer Swift Current Energy beginning in 2025.\n\nSwift Current began construction on the 3,800-acre, 593-megawatt solar farm in central Illinois as part of the same five-year, $422 million agreement. Straddling two counties in central Illinois, the Double Black Diamond Solar project is now the largest solar installation east of the Mississippi River. It can produce enough electricity to power more than 100,000 homes, according to Swift Current’s vice president of origination, Caroline Mann.\n\nChicago alone has agreed to purchase approximately half the installation’s total output, which will cover about 70 percent of its municipal buildings’ electricity needs. City officials plan to cover the remaining 30 percent through the purchase of renewable energy credits.\n\n“That’s really a feature and not a bug of our plan,” said Deputy Chief Sustainability Officer Jared Policicchio. He added that he hopes the city’s demand for 100 percent renewable energy will encourage additional clean energy development locally, albeit on a much smaller scale, which will create new sources of power that the city can then purchase directly, in lieu of credits. “Our goal over the next several years is that we reach a point where we’re not buying renewable energy credits.”\n\nMore than 700 other U.S. cities and towns have signed similar purchasing agreements since 2015, according to a 2022 study from the World Resources Institute. Only one city, Houston, has a larger renewable energy deal than Chicago, according to Matthew Popkin, the cities and communities U.S. program manager at Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit whose research focuses on decarbonization. However, he added, no other contract has added as much new renewable power to the grid as Chicago’s.\n\n“Part of Chicago’s goal was what’s called ‘additionality’: bringing new resources into the market and onto the grid here,” said Popkin.\n\nChicago also secured a $400,000 annual commitment from Constellation and Swift Current for clean energy workforce training, including training via Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit aiming to increase the number of women in union construction and manufacturing jobs.\n\nThe economic benefits extend past the city’s limits: According to Swift Current, approximately $100 million in new tax revenue is projected to flow into Sangamon County and Morgan County, which are home to the Double Black Diamond Solar site, over the project’s operational life.\n\n“Cities and other local governments just don’t appreciate their ability to not just support their residents but also shape markets,” said Popkin. “Chicago is demonstrating directly how cities can lead by example, implement ambitious goals amidst evolving state and federal policy changes, and leverage their purchasing power to support a more equitable renewable energy future.”\n\nAlex Dane, the World Resource Institute’s senior manager for clean energy innovation and partnerships in the U.S. energy program, said many cities have set two renewable energy goals: one for municipal operations and a second goal for the community at large. Even though the latter is “a little bit harder to get to, and the timeline is a little bit further out,” said Dane, the community-side goals begin to seem less lofty once a city has decarbonized the assets it directly controls.\n\nIndeed, Chicago’s new milestone is the first step in a broader goal to source the energy for all buildings in the city from renewables by 2035. That would make it the largest city in the country to do so, according to the Sierra Club.\n\nDane said it will be increasingly important for cities, towns, and states to drive their own efforts to reduce emissions, build greener economies, and meet local climate goals. He said moves like Chicago’s prove that they are capable, no matter what’s on the horizon at the federal level.\n\n“That is an imperative thing to know, that state, city, county action is a durable pathway, even under the next administration, and [it] needs to happen,” said Dane. “The juice is definitely still worth the squeeze.”\n\nThis coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and WBEZ, a public radio station serving the Chicago metropolitan region.\n\nThank you for reading Truthout.

This new relationship is in the best interest of our people and pledges to focus on peace and development in Ogoni primarily.”\n\nThe MOSOP leaders further outlined some demands which they maintained were in line with its ultimate desire for development in the environment.\n\nThey noted, “The unbundling, removal or carve out of the Ogoni fields from the existing Financial and Technical Services Agreement between Sahara and WAGL for the OML 11 concession and the assigning of the Ogoni block to an indigenous operator that is acceptable to all parties, and willing to make concessions and commit a fair proportion of its earnings for Ogoni development.\n\n“The commencement of a judicial review to clear the name of Ogoni Great Martyr Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa and eight of his fellow martyrs and granting posthumous national honour to the foremost martyrs of the Ogoni struggle, aka ‘Ogoni 13,’ who was executed by the Nigerian state on November 10, 1995, during the regime of late Gen. Sani Abacha.\n\n“Fast-tracking the presidential assent to the bill for an Act establishing the Federal University of Environmental Technology, Saakpenwa in Tai Local Government Area of Rivers State,” among other demands.\n\nThe body expressed optimism for the future of Ogoni, saying, “We are pleased to see a new beginning for the Ogoni and we urge everyone’s patience while we further deepen our unity.”\n\nIn his remark, the Head, Media and Communications, Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, Enuolare Mba-Nwigoh, who was represented by the project’s Coordinator, Prof Nenibarini Zabbey assured the people of Ogoni of the agency’s commitment to ensuring environmental sustainability in the area, and urged the people to be patient and peaceful.', 'en', 'Dennis Naku', '2025-01-04 20:00:42', 3, 'Forte pertinence (choc majeur ou immédiat sur les prix)', 70.15, 1, 'crude,oil', '2026-01-13 20:13:07', '2026-01-15 15:45:18', 'MOSOP demands action on trapped crude oil, honour for Saro-Wiwa, others//// https://punchng.com/mosop-demands-action-on-trapped-crude-oil-honour-for-saro-wiwa-others/'),

Biden’s decision, which relies on a rarely used 1953 law, could make it nearly impossible for the incoming Trump administration to reverse without Congress stepping in.\n\nWhat Is Biden Doing?\n\nBiden plans to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from future oil and gas leasing. This includes:\n\nThe Atlantic Coast The Pacific Coast from Washington to California The Eastern Gulf of Mexico Parts of Alaska’s Northern Bering Sea\n\n\n\nThis action is part of Biden’s broader push to cement his environmentalist legacy with a recent flurry of executive acts directed at “climate change.”\n\nWhy Conservatives Are Concerned\n\nFor conservatives, this decision appears to be a power grab.\n\nThe Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act gives presidents the authority to withdraw federal waters from drilling, but it doesn’t explicitly allow them to reverse such actions. This means that undoing Biden’s ban would require Congressional approval, a significant hurdle even with majorities in both chambers.\n\nOne reason Biden’s move is so significant is its permanence.\n\nIn 2019, a federal court upheld a similar action by the Obama administration, ruling against the Trump administration’s attempt to reopen areas for drilling near Alaska. This precedent makes it likely that Biden’s ban will hold up in court.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API) blasted Biden’s decision as “misguided.”\n\nDustin Meyer, API’s senior vice president, said:\n\n“This approach undermines our energy security and shifts production to nations with fewer environmental safeguards.”\n\nFor conservatives, this move could:\n\nHurt Energy Independence: The U.S. has made significant strides in reducing reliance on foreign oil. Blocking offshore drilling could reverse that progress. Impact Jobs: Offshore drilling supports thousands of jobs, from rig workers to engineers. Limiting new opportunities could hit coastal economies hard. Increase Energy Costs: With global demand for oil rising, reducing domestic supply might drive up prices at the pump.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Nevada?\n\nNevada may not have a coastline, but energy policy impacts everyone.\n\nHigher energy costs affect families at the pump and businesses relying on affordable transportation. Additionally, limiting domestic production shifts oil demand to foreign producers, many of whom have poor environmental and human rights records.\n\nFor a state known for its tourism and outdoor recreation, rising energy costs could impact everything from airline tickets to local travel expenses.\n\nCritics and Supporters Weigh In\n\nEnvironmentalists argue that this ban is essential for combating climate change. Jenny Rowland-Shea from the Center for American Progress said:\n\n“These are areas where drilling is not popular. People want their coastal economies and wildlife protected.”\n\nBut energy experts like Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service say the impact on U.S. energy supply will be minimal, noting that offshore projects take years to come online.\n\nKloza said:\n\n“There’s plenty of existing offshore rigs pumping oil in the Gulf of Mexico.”\n\nMeanwhile, some Republicans are already strategizing ways to reverse the ban.\n\nBudget reconciliation—a process that allows legislation to pass with a simple majority—could be used to speed up lease sales in existing areas. Florida Republicans, however, might push to maintain protections for parts of the Gulf, reflecting bipartisan concerns about drilling near their coastline.\n\nThe Bigger Picture\n\nBiden’s offshore drilling ban is a bold move that will shape America’s energy landscape for years to come. Many conservatives see it as another example of government overreach that could hurt the economy and energy independence.\n\nAs the Trump administration prepares to take office, this issue will likely become a flashpoint in the ongoing debate over America’s energy future.\n\nThis article was written with the assistance of AI.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) stands against other energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing.\n\nIn January 2024, the Biden administration paused federal authorizations for several pending LNG export projects, citing concerns about environmental impacts and domestic energy security. The US Department of Energy later released an assessment indicating that increased LNG exports could add 1.5 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2050, equivalent to a quarter of the current emissions of the US. However, President-elect Donald Trump is set to reverse the Biden administration’s pause on liquefied natural gas (LNG) export approvals, marking a significant shift in US energy policy.\n\nOn January 1, Ukraine officially halted the transit of Russian natural gas to several European nations, marking the end of a five-year agreement and closing a chapter in Russia’s decades-long dominance over Europe’s energy markets. The termination of this deal comes amidst the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, with neither side willing to negotiate an extension. Europe is expected to rely heavily on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. Christoph Halser of Rystad Energy estimates that the EU will need to source approximately 7.2 billion cubic meters of gas from the global LNG market.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Low Priced Stocks to Invest in Now and 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nAs Europe pivots away from Russian gas, the United States emerges as a key player in filling the supply gap. US LNG exports to Europe have already been rising in recent years, and this shift presents an even greater opportunity for American energy producers. With robust infrastructure and increased LNG export capacity, the U.S. is well-positioned to strengthen its role as a reliable supplier to Europe, enhancing energy security across the continent while bolstering its own energy industry.\n\nThe growth of US energy exports hinges on significant investments in infrastructure. According to a report by ICF, prepared for the American Petroleum Institute (API), the development of US oil and gas infrastructure is expected to remain robust through 2035. The report highlights that the primary drivers for continued infrastructure development remain strong. Shale and tight oil resource extraction are projected to continue at a rapid pace, supported by advancements in extraction technologies and favorable market responses to competitive commodity prices. Total capital expenditures (CAPEX) for oil and gas infrastructure are projected to range between $1.06 trillion and $1.34 trillion from 2017 to 2035. This equates to an average annual investment of $56 billion to $71 billion, spanning various infrastructure components, including surface and lease equipment, gathering and processing facilities, pipelines for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids (NGLs), storage facilities, refineries, and export terminals.\n\nAs global energy dynamics shift, the United States stands poised to play a pivotal role in ensuring energy security for Europe while driving growth in its own energy sector.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to rank the top 15 energy infrastructure stocks that achieved the highest gains over the past six months. We also included their hedge fund sentiment, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database of 900 elite hedge funds as of Q3 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of 6-month performance, as of January 2.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nDynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG)\n\nReturns in Past 6 Months: 42.12%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nDynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) is a Greece-based company specializing in the ownership and operation of LNG carriers. The company operates a fleet of six LNG vessels that provide maritime transportation services under long-term charters. Dynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) serves prominent gas companies such as Equinor, SEFE, and Yamal Trade.\n\nThe stock price of Dynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) has increased significantly, driven by several key factors. One of the primary reasons for this increase is the company’s successful refinancing of its debt. Dynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) was originally scheduled to pay off a significant portion of its debt in September. However, in June, the company fully repaid its previous credit facility of $408.6 million, ahead of its maturity, and completed a new lease financing agreement with China Development Bank Financial Leasing for four of its LNG carriers. By doing so the company has pushed out its debt maturity to June 2029 for three of its LNG carriers and June 2034 for one remaining vessel, with two of its LNG carriers now operating debt-free. This extension provides Dynagas LNG Partners LP (NYSE:DLNG) with greater financial flexibility and focus on growth and investment opportunities.\n\nAs of September 10, Dynagas LNG Partners LP’s (NYSE:DLNG) fleet has a contracted backlog of approximately $1.04 billion, which translates to an average of about $173 million per vessel. This backlog provides a stable and predictable revenue stream, which has helped to increase investor confidence in the company. Additionally, the company’s average remaining charter period of approximately 6.4 years provides a high level of visibility into its future cash flows, which has also contributed to the increase in stock price.\n\nOverall, DLNG ranks 11th on our list of energy infrastructure stocks that are skyrocketing. While we acknowledge the potential of DLNG to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.
